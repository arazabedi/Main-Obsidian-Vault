Maven is a build management tool allowing you to create cucumber or automation frameworks more easily.

The heart file (.pom) enables us to download the relevant resources to get the project up and running.

I believe Maven is basically Java's NPM.

Put code in the POM file then refresh the Maven module in IntelliJ in order to download whatever dependency you want (e.g. Selenium Webdriver).

Find libraries (dependencies) in MVNRepository.
