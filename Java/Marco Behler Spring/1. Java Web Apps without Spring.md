## Project Setup

Java projects with Maven need a pom.xml file to work (just use IntellJ).

Here is part of a pom.xml file:
```xml
<groupId>com.marcobehler</groupId>
<artifactId>myfancypdfinvoices</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
```

1. Domain name
2. Project name
3. Maven default version

```xml
<packaging>jar</packaging>
```

Maven will default to jar but this explicitly says that it should build to a .jar file.

You can run a 'fat' jar file with:

```xml
java -jar yourjarfile.jar
```

A fat jar file contains all third party libraries in one file. Spring Boot will pre-configure maven to build to fat jar files so that you don't need to build to a .war file (not .jar) and put it in a servlet container like Tomcat to run your web app. 'Fat' jar files include Tomcat.

Tomcat is a java web application server.

```xml
<maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
```

This is to pick the java version.

```xml
<dependencies>
        <!-- Still Empty For Now -->
</dependencies>
```

You can add dependencies here.

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.11.0</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

You can specify the maven plugin if it defaults to an old version that doesn't work with new versions of java.

Now you can validate that everything is there for Maven to work properly:

```zsh
mvn validate
```

The build cycle:

- `validate` - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
- `compile` - compile the source code of the project
- `test` - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
- `package` - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- `verify` - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
- `install` - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- `deploy` - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

## Rendering HTML pages

You need 2 things to display web pages using java:
1. A servlet container (such as Tomcat or Jetty)
2. The HTTP servlet itself

A servlet is a Java class that extends a server's functionality. A servlet is managed by a servlet container and handles HTTP requests, and can provide responses.

You used to have to build your servlet to a .war file and run it through Tomcat, but now Tomcat lives inside your project's .jar build:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
        <artifactId>tomcat-embed-core</artifactId>
        <version>10.1.8</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

tomcat-embed-core is the library you need to write applications for the web in Java.

Next, create the directories that Maven expects for your project:

```zsh
cd /home/marco/myfancypdfinvoices
mkdir -p src/main/java/com/marcobehler
```


Here's the first servlet: 

```java
package com.marcobehler;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MyFirstServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html; charset=UTF-8");
        response.getWriter().print(
                "<html>\n" +
                "<body>\n" +
                "<h1>Hello World</h1>\n" +
                "<p>This is my very first, embedded Tomcat, HTML Page!</p>\n" +
                "</body>\n" +
                "</html>");
    }
}
```

You would set content to JSON (`application/json`) for a react app instead of text/html.

HTML pages are just strings, so you can return HTML through concatenation.

The servlet is ready, but you now need to configure Tomcat and tell it about your servlet.

Here's how to create the Tomcat server:

```java
package com.marcobehler;

import org.apache.catalina.Context;
import org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException;
import org.apache.catalina.Wrapper;
import org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat;

public class ApplicationLauncher {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws LifecycleException {

        Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat();
        tomcat.setPort(8080);
        tomcat.getConnector();

        Context ctx = tomcat.addContext("", null);
        Wrapper servlet = Tomcat.addServlet(ctx, "myFirstServlet", new MyFirstServlet());
        servlet.setLoadOnStartup(1);
        servlet.addMapping("/*");

        tomcat.start();
    }
}
```

First you instantiate a new Tomcat. This doesn't run the server but let's you configure it.

```java
Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat();
```

Next you need to set the port (8080 is convention):

```java
tomcat.setPort(8080);
```

Next you need to add this boilerplate to bootstrap the Tomcat HTTP engine (poor API design - should be unnecessary):

```java
tomcat.getConnector();
```

Historically you could run many different web apps under different paths on the same Tomcat. We only have one app so we can put `""` as contextPath:

```java
Context ctx = tomcat.addContext("", null);
```

^bbd77f

The second parameter would be the `docBase` (reference to a directory containing static files that Tomcat can deliver). We don't have any static files so leave it as `null`.

Next, add your servlet to Tomcat:

```java
Wrapper servlet = Tomcat.addServlet(ctx, "myFirstServlet", new MyFirstServlet());
```

The servlet name doesn't matter but needs to be unique in that Tomcat instance.

Starting up Tomcat does not automatically load your servlet. Instead it will get initialised on the first HTTP request. You can set it to start immediately with the following code:

```java
servlet.setLoadOnStartup(1);
```

Now you need to tell Tomcat that your servlet should react to *any* request that starts with "/".

```java
servlet.addMapping("/*");
```

Next, start Tomcat:

```java
tomcat.start();
```

You can compile the code and execute the specified compiled class with the following command:

```zsh
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.marcobehler.ApplicationLauncher"
```

(Make sure that the mainClass points to the correct package).

**OR**

Just run the main method of the ApplicationLauncher class.

You can now package the application into a .jar file and run it that way:

```zsh
mvn package
```

Maven will package up your source code and put it into a .jar file in the target directory (specified the pom.xml).

You can try to run it but it will fail because you need to specify the class to run:

```zsh
java -jar target\myfancypdfinvoices-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To specify the class you want to run, add a Manifest file:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <archive>
            <manifest>
                <mainClass>com.marcobehler.ApplicationLauncher</mainClass>
            </manifest>
        </archive>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

This will install the maven jar plugin and configure it to run the ApplicationLauncher file. Maven will create a manifest.mf file pointing to: 

com.marcobehler.ApplicationLauncher

Now repackage and rerun:

```zsh
mvn package
java -jar target/myfancypdfinvoices-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

There's still an error (Error: Unable to initialize main class com.marcobehler.ApplicationLauncher Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: jakarta/servlet/Servlet).

Because Maven is stupid. It doesn't automatically put external libraries into the .jar file.

You need yet another plugin - shade.

```java
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.1</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>shade</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <transformers>
                    <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
                        <mainClass>com.marcobehler.ApplicationLauncher</mainClass>
                    </transformer>
                </transformers>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

When you execute `mvn package`, shade will execute its shade goal - to include 3rd party libraries in the .jar file in addition to source code:

```xml
<execution>
    <phase>package</phase>
    <goals>
        <goal>shade</goal>
    </goals>
```

You also need to set the main class:

```xml
<configuration>
    <transformers>
        <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
            <mainClass>com.marcobehler.ApplicationLauncher</mainClass>
        </transformer>
    </transformers>
</configuration>
```

You need to add this because shade unzips every 3rd party library and puts it in the .jar file - but - if a library has a manifest.mf, it might overwrite your own (and other previous manifests). Shade uses the specified main class here to make sure that the final manifest file has the correct class specified. 

You can now delete maven-jar-plugin.

Now:

```zsh
mvn package
java -jar target/myfancypdfinvoices-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Shade creates a _dependency-reduce.pom.xml_ - it can be deleted safely.

Ignore META-INF file warnings.

Congrats! You've created an executable .jar file with an embedded Tomcat, serving HTML pages.

Now that was long. That's what Spring Boot is for. To do this boilerplate for you.

So remember shade. It's a jar creator that puts the 3rd party libraries in the jar.

A .jar file is an executable (if Java is installed) bundle of java code. It just contains all of your bytecode (.class files) along with other resources such as images, config, files etc.

So a .jar file can contain bytecode, which the JVM executes.

`Spring Boot Maven/Gradle plugin` will do all this. It is added to a Spring Boot project through Spring Initializr.



## JSON Endpoints

Here's how to respond to different request urls:

```java
package com.marcobehler;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MyFancyPdfInvoicesServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/")) {
            response.setContentType("text/html; charset=UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().print(
                    "<html>\n" +
                            "<body>\n" +
                            "<h1>Hello World</h1>\n" +
                            "<p>This is my very first, embedded Tomcat, HTML Page!</p>\n" +
                            "</body>\n" +
                            "</html>");
        }
        else if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {
            response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().print("[]");
        }
    }
}
```

We've changed the name to MyFancyPdfInvoicesServlet:

```java
public class MyFancyPdfInvoicesServlet extends HttpServlet {
```

We've also added if statements to process differing urls:

```java
if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/")) {
}
else if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {
}
```

When the request is from /invoices, we return JSON:

```java
else if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {
    response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
    response.getWriter().print("[]");
}
```

Here, we've returned an empty JSON array using the `getWriter()` method.

Run the programme and you should see an empty JSON array in the browser at the url: 
http://localhost:8080/invoices

Right now we can only handle GET requests.

But we want to respond to a request with:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": "freddieFox",
  "amount": 50,
  "pdf_url": "https://cdn.myfancypdfinvoices.com/invoice-freddieFox-1.pdf"
}
```

To be able to create invoices, we need the following:

1. Handle POST request
2. Read user_id and amount parameter values
3. Create an invoice class
4. Convert invoice to JSON through a 3rd part JSON library

Let's create the Invoice class first.

We need a class with the following variables.

```java
public class Invoice {
    private String id;
    private String userId;
    private String pdfUrl;
    private Integer amount;
    }
```

Add getters and setters and constructors:

```java
public Invoice() { }

public Invoice(String userId, Integer amount, String pdfUrl) {
        this.id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        this.userId = userId;
        this.pdfUrl = pdfUrl;
        this.amount = amount;
    }

public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

...
...
```

We have two constructors because one just creates an invoice object without defaults, and the other creates a random id and takes parameters to fill the pdf.


Now we create an InvocieService class which will actually carry out the invoice creation:

```java
package com.marcobehler;

public class InvoiceService {

    public Invoice create(String userId, Integer amount) {
        // TODO real pdf creation and storing it on network server
        return new Invoice(userId, amount, "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf");
    }

}
```

The InvoiceService class has one method *create* which take *user_id* and *amount*. This will create a PDF (in this course we will use the same dummy PDF for all invoices).

Now we need our JSON library. Add jackson-databind to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
        <version>2.15.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Next refactor the servlet:

```java
public class MyFancyPdfInvoicesServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {

            String userId = request.getParameter("user_id");
            Integer amount = Integer.valueOf(request.getParameter("amount"));

            Invoice invoice = new InvoiceService().create(userId, amount);

            response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
            String json = new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(invoice);
            response.getWriter().print(json);
        } else {
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }
```

This needs a breakdown:

You already had a *doGet* method override, now you need a *doPos*t to handle POST requests:

```java
@Override
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
```

Next we're just getting the values from the request:

```java
String userId = request.getParameter("user_id");
Integer amount = Integer.valueOf(request.getParameter("amount"));
```

In production this would need validation - that'll come with Spring.

Next we'll create a new InvoiceService object to create the new Invoice object:

```java
Invoice invoice = new InvoiceService().create(userId, amount);
```

Now you need to turn the invoice object into a JSON string using Jackson's *objectMapper* object:

```java
String json = new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(invoice);
response.getWriter().print(json);
```

Now you can use your new endpoint /invoices to send a POST request! You can use IntelliJ's built in HTTP client:

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/invoices?user_id=freddieFox&amount=50
Accept: application/json

###
```

The response:

```json
{
    "id": "f1cc98aa-9411-40f7-bab1-3857326e1651",
    "userId": "freddieFox",
    "pdfUrl": "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf",
    "amount": 50
}
```

But unfortunately this is camel-case, and we want underscores. So we'll have to configure Jackson by adding decorators to the instance variables:

```java
public class Invoice {

    private String id;

    @JsonProperty("user_id")
    private String userId;

    @JsonProperty("pdf_url")
    private String pdfUrl;

    private Integer amount;
```

Now you should get snake-case json:

```json
{
    "id": "0afca669-cee2-4472-b7bb-37445c9af939",
    "amount": 50,
    "user_id": "freddieFox",
    "pdf_url": "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf"
}
```

The InvoiceService only creates a method to create invoices, but let's give it a method to find existing invoices. We'll use an in-memory list to store invoices instead of a database for now.

```java
package com.marcobehler;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

public class InvoiceService {

    List<Invoice> invoices = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>(); // 

    public List<Invoice> findAll() {
        return invoices;
    }

    public Invoice create(String userId, Integer amount) {
        // TODO real pdf creation and storing it on network server
        Invoice invoice = new Invoice(userId, amount, "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf");
        invoices.add(invoice);
        return invoice;
    }
}
```

CopyOnWriteArrayList is just a thread-safe ArrayList.

Now we're going to refactor the servlet and change the doGet method:

```java
package com.marcobehler;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class MyFancyPdfInvoicesServlet extends HttpServlet {

    private InvoiceService invoiceService = new InvoiceService();
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    @Override
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {

            String userId = request.getParameter("user_id");
            Integer amount = Integer.valueOf(request.getParameter("amount"));

            Invoice invoice = invoiceService.create(userId, amount);

            response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
            String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(invoice);
            response.getWriter().print(json);
        } else {
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/")) {
            response.setContentType("text/html; charset=UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().print(
                    "<html>\n" +
                            "<body>\n" +
                            "<h1>Hello World</h1>\n" +
                            "<p>This is my very first, embedded Tomcat, HTML Page!</p>\n" +
                            "</body>\n" +
                            "</html>");
        } else if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {
            response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
            List<Invoice> invoices = invoiceService.findAll();  // 
            response.getWriter().print(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(invoices));  // 
        }
    }
}
```

BREAKDOWN:

We've added two instance variables to the servlet so you don't need to instantiate them all the time whenever someone calls the doGet or doPost method. One instance of these services is enough:

```java
private InvoiceService invoiceService = new InvoiceService();
private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
```

`new InvoiceService` and `new ObjectMapper` is replaced with references to the new variables:

```java
@Override
protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
    if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {

        String userId = request.getParameter("user_id");
        Integer amount = Integer.valueOf(request.getParameter("amount"));

        Invoice invoice = invoiceService.create(userId, amount);

        response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
        String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(invoice);
        response.getWriter().print(json);
    } else {
        response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
```

Try out the new app:

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/invoices?user_id=freddieFox&amount=50
Accept: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache

###
```

Retrieve the invoices:

```http
GET http://localhost:8080/invoices
Accept: application/json
```

Nice! We have a functioning GET and POST.

Now for some package refactoring:

- Put your domain classes (like invoice), into a sub-package called model.

- Your services (InvoiceService), into a sub-package service.

- Your servlet or web-related classes, into a sub-package web.

- Make the root package {groupId.appName}, e.g. com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.

- Leave the application launcher in the root package.

## Poor Man's Dependency Injection

In the last step we added two variables to the servlet (invoiceService and objectMapper).

But what if some other class needs to convert between Java and JSON as well? They would also need an ObjectMapper. What if some other module needs access to your InvoiceService. 

In that case, private instance variables (fields) in the servlet won't cut it.

You'd want a central place where you can define all these services and then somehow access them.

Without Spring, one way to do this is though implementing the Application class pattern - a poor man's version of dependency management.

Create the Application class under a context sub-package:

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.context;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.service.InvoiceService;

public class Application {

    public static final InvoiceService invoiceService = new InvoiceService();
    public static final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

}
```

This class effectively makes the InvoiceService and ObjectMapper classes singletons (only one instance of that class).

You can now alter you servlet to incorporate the Application pattern:

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.web;

import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.context.Application;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.model.Invoice;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class MyFancyPdfInvoicesServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {

            String userId = request.getParameter("user_id");
            Integer amount = Integer.valueOf(request.getParameter("amount"));

            Invoice invoice = Application.invoiceService.create(userId, amount);

            response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
            String json = Application.objectMapper.writeValueAsString(invoice);
            response.getWriter().print(json);
        } else {
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {
        if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/")) {
            response.setContentType("text/html; charset=UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().print(
                    "<html>\n" +
                            "<body>\n" +
                            "<h1>Hello World</h1>\n" +
                            "<p>This is my very first, embedded Tomcat, HTML Page!</p>\n" +
                            "</body>\n" +
                            "</html>");
        } else if (request.getRequestURI().equalsIgnoreCase("/invoices")) {
            response.setContentType("application/json; charset=UTF-8");
            List<Invoice> invoices = Application.invoiceService.findAll();
            response.getWriter().print(Application.objectMapper.writeValueAsString(invoices));
        }
    }
}
```

Basically we're adding `Application.` to every use of InvoiceService or ObjectMapper because we're getting them from the Application class rather than directly, so as to only have one instance of them in the entire application.

So, put your services in the Application class. 

Next we're going to add users to our application. So make a POJO (plain old java object):

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.model;

public class User {

    private String id;
    private String name;

    public User() {
    }

    public User(String id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

Then add a UserService to find users (we'll just return a dummy user for now):

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.services;

import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.model.User;

import java.util.UUID;

public class UserService {

    public User findById(String id) {
        String randomName = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        // always "finds" the user, every user has a random name
        return new User(id, randomName);
    }
}
```

Add some validation:

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.services;

import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.model.Invoice;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.model.User;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

public class InvoiceService {

    List<Invoice> invoices = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

    public List<Invoice> findAll() {
        return invoices;
    }

    public Invoice create(String userId, Integer amount) {
        User user = new UserService().findById(userId);
        if (user == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }


        // TODO real pdf creation and storing it on network server
        Invoice invoice = new Invoice(userId, amount, "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf");
        invoices.add(invoice);
        return invoice;
    }
}
```

Here's the breakdown\:

```java
public Invoice create(String userId, Integer amount) {
    User user = new UserService().findById(userId);
```

Before creating an invoice, you construct a new UserService and check if that user exists.

```java
if (user == null) {
    throw new IllegalStateException();
}
```

If the user doesn't exist then throw an exception. You should add an error message at a later time.

HOWEVER. Creating the UserService instance in the InvoiceService felt weird didn't it? We have that global Application class to keep track of all the other classes. So let's refactor.

Add UserService to Application:

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.context;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.services.InvoiceService;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.services.UserService;

public class Application {

    public static final InvoiceService invoiceService = new InvoiceService();
    public static final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
    public static final UserService userService = new UserService();
}
```

And change the InvoiceService code to get the userService from Application:

```java
public Invoice create(String userId, Integer amount) {
    User user = Application.userService.findById(userId);
    if (user == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException();
    }
```

BUT! This is still not optimal. Why?

Because InvoiceService still needs to actively call the Application again, to get an instance of UserService.

It has to know about the UserService and where is can get a UserService from.

Now let's use dependency injection so that InvoiceService doesn't need to know about UserService and can simply just use it.

First, InvoiceService should be able to take a userService as an instance variable.

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.services;

import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.context.Application;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.model.Invoice;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.model.User;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

public class InvoiceService {

    private final UserService userService;

    private List<Invoice> invoices = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

    public InvoiceService(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    public List<Invoice> findAll() {
        return invoices;
    }

    public Invoice create(String userId, Integer amount) {
        User user = userService.findById(userId);
        if (user == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }


        // TODO real pdf creation and storing it on network server
        Invoice invoice = new Invoice(userId, amount, "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf");
        invoices.add(invoice);
        return invoice;
    }
}
```

We added a final USerService to the InvoiceService class:

```java
public class InvoiceService {

    private final UserService userService;
```

Everyone who tries to construct an InvoiceService needs to pass a UserService:

```java
public InvoiceService(UserService userService) {
    this.userService = userService;
}
```

The create method just uses the UserService:

```java
public Invoice create(String userId, Integer amount) {
    User user = userService.findById(userId);
    if (user == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException();
```

Now update the Application class so that invoiceService takes a userService:

```java
package com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.context;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.service.InvoiceService;
import com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.service.UserService;

public class Application {

    public static final UserService userService = new UserService();
    public static final InvoiceService invoiceService = new InvoiceService(userService);
    public static final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
}
```

UserService needs to be created before InvoiceService:

```java
public static final UserService userService = new UserService();
```

"Inject" the userService into the InvoiceService:

```java
public static final InvoiceService invoiceService = new InvoiceService(userService);
```

Now, instead of getting dependencies from the Application class, they are "wired" together, passively, in the Application class.

But imagine if the UserService had other dependencies. Putting everything into one Application class would get rather unwieldy.

That is *exactly* where the Spring framework comes in: to replace that Application class.

We'll see how that works in the next module!

## Overview and Challenge 

The challenge is to make a banking app REST server. I'll note down the key points I need here.

TO DO:
1. [[1. Java Web Apps without Spring#1. Configure pom.xml|Configure pom.xml by adding dependencies and plugins]]

##### 1. Configure pom.xml

Dependencies:
org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core (server library - like express)
com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind (json library for returning JSON strings and manipulating with decorators)

Build plugins:

org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin (this is the standard maven compiler - don't think it needs to be explicitly coded as it will default - add if theres a version error or something).
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-shade-plugin (for adding 3rd party libraries to .jar bundle - remeber to change the 'main' class, as in the Java Main that we execute from.).

```xml
<build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.11.0</version>
            </plugin>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.4.1</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>shade</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <transformers>
                                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
                                    <mainClass>com.marcobehler.myfancypdfinvoices.ApplicationLauncher</mainClass>
                                </transformer>
                            </transformers>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

##### 2. Create the servlet

First do the tomcat stuff:

```java
package com.marcobehler.mybank;


import org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException;
import org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat;

public class ApplicationLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws LifecycleException {
        String port = System.getProperty("server.port", "8080");
        Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat();
        tomcat.setPort(Integer.parseInt(port));
        tomcat.getConnector(); // This triggers the connector to listen on the specified port

        tomcat.start();
    }
}
```

The port thing is to meet this requirement: Without using any other 3rd party-libraries, enhance your project so that you can call `_java -jar -Dserver.port=8090 {jarname}.jar_' and Tomcat boots up on port 8090, instead of 8080. Default to port 8080, if no system property is set.

Then add some more boilerplate:

```java
package com.marcobehler.mybank;


import com.marcobehler.mybank.web.MyBankServlet;
import org.apache.catalina.Context;
import org.apache.catalina.LifecycleException;
import org.apache.catalina.Wrapper;
import org.apache.catalina.startup.Tomcat;

public class ApplicationLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws LifecycleException {
        String port = System.getProperty("server.port", "8080");
        Tomcat tomcat = new Tomcat();
        tomcat.setPort(Integer.parseInt(port));
        tomcat.getConnector();

        Context ctx = tomcat.addContext("", null);
        Wrapper servlet = Tomcat.addServlet(ctx, "myBankServlet", new MyBankServlet());
        servlet.setLoadOnStartup(1);
        servlet.addMapping("/*");
        
        tomcat.start();
    }
}
```
