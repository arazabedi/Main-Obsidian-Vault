By degrading its international reputation for reliability, he argued, Great Britain would “not escape the most serious and grave economic consequences.”29 He did not, however, emphasize that his country was at that very moment on the brink of financial ruin. — [[16/02/2024]]

> The chief matter for the Bank of England was not gold but economic power, just as the chief question for the war to come was not how many rifles to fire but how to secure Great Britain’s political dominion. Gold was a tool, and perhaps a weapon, but not an end in itself. “It is useless to accumulate gold reserves in times of peace unless it is intended to utilise them in time of danger,” Keynes wrote to Lloyd George. The moment of peril had arrived.30 — [[16/02/2024]]

> On Tuesday, August 4, German troops moved into Belgium. Within hours, the British government retaliated by declaring war on Germany.

> It worked. The British public accepted the new paper currency. The Bank of England stabilized. Prices didn’t skyrocket. People even began making deposits at their local banks instead of withdrawing money.38 Although the stock market would remain shuttered for another five months, the most dangerous, acute phase of the crisis was over.39 And it had ended with London’s financial power fully intact. As nation after nation announced that it would suspend international gold payments, Great Britain was the only major country to maintain its foreign gold commitments in full.40 — [[16/02/2024]]
