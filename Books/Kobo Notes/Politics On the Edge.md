> It was my speech forty years ago. Then, the party wanted MPs who were in favour of capital punishment and against Europe. And I didn’t fit the bill. But I developed tricks. If I were asked “What would you do if someone killed your sister?” I would say “I am not in favour of capital punishment, but I would kill the man myself.” And they would cheer. Or I would say “I am personally in favour of the single market, but if the European Union,”’ here he winked, ‘“ever tried to abolish the Queen I would lead the march on Brussels myself.” You will still need my guaranteed structure which never failed. It goes: “I am going to answer three questions – why me, why this constituency, why the Conservative Party …”’
