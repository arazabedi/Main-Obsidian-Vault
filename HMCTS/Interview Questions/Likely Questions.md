# General Questions
## Tell me about yourself

I'm a junior software engineer with an interest in building software that makes a meaningful impact in society and in people's lives. 

I actually started my career in finance and accounting roles and that really shaped how I think about software. I saw first-hand how bad processes can slow people and organisations down, and how dramatically the right tools can improve quality of life as well as productivity. I took the initiative in these previous roles to to improve workflows and process. For example I pushed for the use of software solutions over email and Excel in my capacity as an accounts assistant, significantly cutting down manual operations, and this is actually in part what led me down the path of retraining as a software developer.

Since then I've build my programming skills through self-led teaching, an internship at a digital marketing outfit, and most recently I joined Digital Futures as a software engineer trainee. At Digital Futures I underwent their 3-month full-stack development programme, gaining an Oracle Java certification, and went on to work on a number of projects as a consultant for them including an internal teaching tool, a data-driven LLM comparison platform, as well as being on placement at Cognizant for their work on the HMRC Valuation Office Agency's digital transformation programme.

I'm looking to join HMCTS for a number of reasons. It's a tech stack that I'm familiar with (at least the backend). Also the mission is important - the justice system is a vital part of our society and I think working in such an organisation has an inherent value in that your daily work is contributing to improvements that may help vulnerable people gain access to services they need, or it may help the system to deliver a better service that might impact people I know or even myself some day.

I want to be a part of a team that's modernising the experience of the justice system, using clean, well-tested code, with clear documentation, and collaboration with stakeholders to deliver services that are fair, efficient, and accessible.

I think my blend of practical experience, strong user mindset, and a genuine belief in public service makes me a good fit for HMCTS and the cross-cutting team.
## Why do you want to work for HMCTS?

I want to work at HMCTS in part because I'm interested in building software that has a meaningful impact. I feel that technology can have a huge impact in improving public sector services and I thoroughly believe in modernisation and the benefits that can have for people's day-to-day lives. I've seen first hand how good systems can improve user experience, and how much of a negative impact bad systems have.

What appeals about HMCTS in particular (as opposed to civil service in general) is its scale and mission. I'm really enthused about the idea of building software that helps out society in general, that contributes to a well-functioning justice system, and that would give me a real sense of purpose in my work. 

For me this is a great environment to grow as a developer whilst contributing to something really important beyond let's say commercial goals. It aligns with my personal growth ambitions and well as my values around social contribution.

**Key Points**
- Reform programme - a once-in-a-generation chance to be at the forefront of significant change projects in the organisation. Thought the Reform Programme has ended, HMCTS is still continuing to enhance their services through new technology.
- The tech stack - I have experience with Spring as well as JS frontends (although through React rather than Nunjucks, but I do understand templating from Ruby on Rails)
- Given that they're even hiring junior engineers - it's a good sign that they are aiming to continually develop their tech offering over the coming years.

**Why am I a good fit?**
- I have the 3 main principles they are looking for - continuous change, managing uncertainty, and designing services around user needs.
- Continuous change - talk about how I am consciously keeping up to date with technology, news, and and clued-up.
- Managing uncertainty - talk about how I am always thinking about different scenarios and how to handle them
- Designing services around user needs - talk about how I build user interfaces based on an understanding of how they are likely to intuit how to use the interfaces (can include a discussion about Power Platform and Dynamics 365)
## Give a time when you faced a challenge and tell me how you solved it?

**S - Situation**
Whilst working for Digital Futures I was put on a project building a full-stack application to help businesses make informed decisions about the various different Large Language Models available out there. We were under time pressure in a hackathon scenario, and the design brief was vague and still evolving due to last-minute changes from both stakeholders and the data team.

**T - Task**
I had to decide on a UI architecture and component system that could accommodate changing data inputs without delaying development or confusing the team.

**A - Action**
I quickly came upon two options - wait for the finalised data before designing the UI, or continue with a modular layout using placeholder components and types that we could later alter to fit the real data. I held meetings with the backend and data analysts to confirm that the data structures wouldn't change dramatically, and based on that opted to move forward with flexible data-agnostic components rather than more embarking on a path of building a more custom, but ultimately likely more data-specific and tightly coupled component system.

**R - Result**
This allowed us to start building immediately whilst remaining adaptable to changing circumstances. When the data was finalised, we only had to tweak our components slightly. That allowed us to stay ahead of schedule and gave me time to embellish the front end with modern styling and neat animations that got strong praise from the stakeholders. I learned that decisiveness, calculated risk-taking, and consultation in the face of imperfect information can be more effective that waiting for all the information.
## * Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision with limited information.

**S - Situation**
While I was working at Full Comms, we were building a marketing portal for an broadband provider called 4th Utility. The deadline was tight, and during development we hit a roadblock. The client hadn't finalised their branding guidelines of content structure, but we still needed to move ahead to stay on track for launch.

**T - Task**
As the front-end lead on the project, I had to decide how to proceed with the layout and component structure for the homepage and key subpages. Waiting for final specs could've cause delays, but pushing ahead ahead direction might mean that we would have to redo a lot of work. I had to make decisions with limited information.

**A - Action**
I assessed what I *did* know, which was largely from earlier marketing materials and older versions of their site as well as general brand direction notes from meetings with the stakeholders. I reviewed similar projects that the company had done in the past and established a sensible design baseline. I then build out a modular blade component-based layout in Laravel which gave us flexibility to quickly swap content or styling once the brand guidelines came in. I document design assumptions and flagged areas where placeholder logic was used so that changes could be made quickly.

**R - Result**
When the final branding and content structure came through, not many tweaks were actually needed. We were able to adhere to the guidelines with some minor reworking of the codebase. Therefore the project launched on time with client approval for both the flexibility of the design (as we also implemented a content management system for them) and our responsiveness to the lack of information. The key take-away for me was that absent information requires decisions that are easily reversible or flexible that are communicated transparently. It taught me how to balance action with risk management which is crucial in any time-sensitive environment.
# Describe a time you had to work with people outside your immediate team. How did you build effective relationships?

**S - Situation**
During my time at Urban Construction Management, I was working in a very generalist capacity, cutting through IT, finance and operational functions. At one point there was a recurring issue with delays in invoice approvals due to poor communication between project managers, site teams, and the accounts team.

**T - Task**
I took it upon myself to investigate how I could perhaps build a system that could streamline this particular workflow in order to reduce friction between cross-departmental teams and reduce time wasted chasing down approvals or information.

**A - Action**
I spent a few weeks setting up conversations with colleagues across departments, and even went on site to talk to site managers in order to understand their pain points. I took notes and spent the time we had together not just in a transactional capacity but also had informal lunches with some of my colleagues to get to know them better. By having more of an insight into their work and by building a rapport I managed to get buy-in from my colleagues for using a very basic shared Google Sheets tracker with automated reminders for invoice deadliness and delivery milestones. I walked each team through the process in person and invited their feedback, tweaking the solution based on their input, being careful to speak their own language. For accounts it was about reconciliation and due dates; for site managers it was about not getting buried in admin.

**R - Result**
The new system improved visibility and accountability between departments. Invoice approvals became faster and issues were solved in a timely fashion. But it wasn't just the technology that made this possible, it was that I built trust by showing each team that I understood their concerns and was genuinely there to help. This experience taught me a lot about bridging gaps between technical and non-technical teams and that's something that carries over to a software engineering context.
## * Describe a time when you had to meet a tight deadline. How did you deliver to a good standard? (This answer goes heavy into the good standard part)

**S - Situation**
I consulted for Cognizant on contract from Digital Futures as part of the HMRC Valuation Office Agency digital transformation, working on a team that was delivering internal tools using Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365. There was one particular deliverable involving an update to a case management interface that was due for stakeholder testing within a few days. The delivery date was set in stone because it was part of a wider demo for senior stakeholders.

**T - Task**
My task was to build and customise specific components within the Power Apps interface and configure workflow logic in Power Automate. And then I had to ensure that it worked smoothly with the test data that we had in Dynamics 365.

**A - Action**
Firstly I broke the task into clear subcomponents. I prioritised each in terms of how vital they were to the overall deliverable. First starting with the core user journeys, then validations, and then styling. I noted down potential blockers as part of the preparation process, and identified a mismatch between our data model (tables, fields, relationships) and what the reporting layer (Power BI, paginated reports, custom dashboards) expected. I proactively reached out to a senior member of the team to coordinate a session to align the schema, I also consulted with the product owner to scope down some non-critical styling tweaks so we could prioritise functionality. At the same time I kept in close contact with the QAs so they could start testing modules as soon as they were ready rather than waiting for the whole feature to be complete. I documented the business logic for handover and added test cases for the wider team to be able to use during the stakeholder demo.

**R - Result**
We hit the deadline as the build was delivered on time and passed initial testing. The stakeholder feedback was positive in particular with regard to how well it integrated in the broader Dynamics system. In order to deliver at pace whilst keeping the standard high I needed to prioritise clearly and communicate effectively across functions. I was also adaptable to feedback and able to get past hurdles quickly as a result. This gave me real confidence in working under pressure while staying aligned to wider team needs.
## How did you improve a system in the past?

**S - Situation**
When I first started working as an accounts assistant at Pangea Resourcing, my main responsibility was generating around 200 invoices a week using Sage. The process involved manually collecting data from timesheets and expenses claims from disparate emails, inputting them into an Excel spreadsheet, and then manually entering each line into Sage. It was an extremely time-consuming process that took up most of my week, as well as being prone to human-error. It was a clear bottleneck in clearing backlogs and contributed to cash flow problems for the company.

**T - Task**
I wanted to reduce the manual workload and the error rate on the invoices. At the time we had no unified system for keeping track of data, nor any automated workflows, so the first task was to find tools that could centralise data whilst fitting into our workflow.

**A - Action**
The first thing I did was document the existing end-to-end process for invoicing to specifically point out inefficiencies and data handoff issues. I then approached the Senior Accounts Assistant with a proposal to explore centralisation and automation. Together we researched SaaS options that could integrate with Sage, such as middleware that could automatically pull timesheets and expenses from other systems. We evaluated the tools based on their cost, security, Sage compatibility, and ease of implementation.

At that point we started to loop in the IT team to present our solutions as they would be the ones to implement. Together we took our proposal to management, outlining the expected time savings, reduced error rates, and the impact on the company's cash flow - I supported by providing a prototype workflow in the presentation to explain the logic.

The first change we introduced was Bullhorn, which managed timesheets. I helped to define the data structures we needed, such as hours, project codes, and PO references. This replaced a network of unruly spreadsheets with a single interface. For expenses we decided to use Concur, which we used to keep receipts, travel invoices and so on. 

I worked with the IT team to design automations that pulled time and expense data from Bullhorn and Concur, matched them with the appropriate client rate and rate structures, and generated drafts of invoices. We then used AutoEntry and some custom scripting to upload these files (expenses, receipts etc.) into Sage directly, which cut out all the manual input needed from before our digital transformation. Eventually we went a step further and built a workflow that automatically generated and emailed invoices to clients once approved. The approval step maintained quality control whilst massively reducing workload.

**R - Result**
The changes completely overhauled my team's working day. We were no longer constantly trying to keep our head over water with the receivables over our payables. There were far fewer errors as a result of manual data entry, and the invoice cycle was dramatically sped-up. Clients received their invoices faster, and that meant our cash flow improved, giving the company more leeway to scale. For me personally, it was also a turning point as it gave me firsthand experience in what digital transformation can achieve. It's a large part of what motivated me to retrain as a software engineer.
## What are you most proud of?

**S - Situation**

One of the things I'm most proud of is the work I did to overhaul the invoicing process at Pangea Resourcing. When I first joined as an accounts assistant, the process was entirely manual and I was writing out lines of text and filling in forms in Sage by typing. It was extremely time-consuming which had implications for the company's cash flow.

**T - Task**
I didn't accept that as just "how things are". I initiated discussions with my senior accounts assistant and with IT. Over time we introduce Bullhorn for time tracking and storing pay structures. Concur for keeping expense documents and data. We eventually had a largely automated system that removed Excel from the workflow completely. I helped design integrations that pulled data from Bullhorn and Concur, formatted it for Sage, and even automatically generated some of the invoices for quick approval and automatic emailing out.

**R - Result**
The result was a huge reduction in admin time, a big drop in errors, and much improved cash flow for the business. For me personally, it was also this experience which made me realise how powerful software can be when it's applied thoughtfully and this was part of what inspired me to retrain as a software engineer. I'm proud not just of the work that I did but because I had to build trust across teams, solve not just technical but also business challenges, and got to see the impact of that work play out in the organisation.
## How do you deal with conflict in a team?

**S - Situation**

During a hackathon I was part of a cross-functional team building a full-stack app to help businesses assess different large-language models. I built the core backend architecture using Node.js, rolling authentication and setting up the database and so on, and then left the filling out of the backend logic for another team member so I could lead on front-end development as my team-mate was more confident on the backend. Other teammates focused on data analysis and data engineering.

**T - Task**
At one point there was a conflict between my vision of the front-end and the data team. The analysts wanted to prioritise showing very detailed model metrics. From my perspective that would make the UI very cluttered and harder to navigate, and would also be hard to deliver in a short period of time. I felt that the interface should be very clean and user friendly, as part of the brief was that the application should be designed for a non-technical audience.

**A - Action**
Rather than push back immediately, I arranged a meeting where I actively listened to the data team's priorities. I acknowledges their experience in the data sphere and the reasons they gave for why accuracy and depth mattered. Then I explained the trade-offs in terms of user experience and the feasibility problems I faced given the time restraints. We ended up deciding on key features that would balance the analyst's desire for detail, as well as the desire on my end to keep things intuitive and quick to implement. Throughout I focused on the shared goal of building to the stakeholder's expectations something impactful but within the allotted timeframe.

**R - Result**
The final design was well-received, and we ended up as runners-up in the competition, largely due to the clarity and modern styling of the user interface. the experience reinforced for me that disagreements in a team can in fact lead to positive outcomes if handled with mutual respect and a focus on outcomes, as sometimes the best solutions can come because people challenge each other.

## You're assigned a task using a tech stack that you are not familiar with. What is your approach?

**S - Situation**
I was working on a personal health tracking app that would let users log calories, track weight over time, and get analytics on their progress. I had a clear idea of the features, but I wanted to build the backend in Node.js, even though I'd never used in before. I'd come from more of a front-end background, having used Python and Ruby a bit in the backend.

**T - Task**
My goal was to build a REST (**Representational State Transfer**) API that could handle user authentication (maybe talk about bcrypt, salt, jwt), store health data securely, and support analysis such as weight trends.

**A - Action**
I broke the learning into manageable chunks. I started off by watching an online tutorial of an experienced developer building the core architecture of his Express server, and paid close attention to how all the part worked together. I followed along as he was doing it by coding a similar solution out myself. Once I had a basic structure and understood how to use it, I read official Node.js and Express documentation, and followed well-reviewed tutorials to better understand routing, middleware, and async handling. I then looked at some public GitHub repos with clean project structures to see how experienced developers were organising their codebases.

As I had previously used MongoDB, I decided to use that with Mongoose for the daatabase layer, which went smoothly due to the abundance of resources online. For the authentication, I had the basic structure of JWT auth implemented from the original YouTube tutorial I had watched, but decided to consult further tutorials on how to implement a role-based auth, slightly altering the existing architecture by adding a bit more logic into the filter and changing the User Object in the database.

I consistently tested endpoints as I went along using Postman, and when I got stuck I used ChatGPT to explain to me what my error messages meant, or what the possible reason was for me not getting the result I intended.

I made sure to write modular, well-commented code so I could easily come back to sections and pick up where I left off.

**R - Result**
The app worked. I got user sign-up and sign-in complete with roles, calorie tracking, weight logs, and generally became more comfortable with Node.js and backend development in general. That foundation helped me later when I learned Spring as I already had a core understanding of Services, Controllers, Models, Database Layer etc. It was a reminder that a new tool isn't a blocker, but an opportunity to learn.

# How would you go about managing conflict with team members?

**S - Situation**
While working on a marketing portal website at Full Comms, a disagreement arose between the front-end and design teams about how to implement navigation. The designers wanted a very custom, visually complex display, but the developers flagged concerns about performance and accessibility.

**T - Task**
As a member of the front-end team, I needed to help resolve the conflict quickly to keep the project on schedule while ensuring a high-quality user experience

**A - Action**
I set up a meeting with both teams, encouraging everyone to explain their priorities and constraints without interruptions. I acknowledged the designer's desire for a rich visual experience and the developer's focus on usability, accessibility, and maintainability. I then prototyping a simpler version of the menu that met accessibility standards whilst retaining some of the design flair. Throughout, I kept communication open, respectful, and emphasised our shared goals of user satisfaction and meeting project deadlines, and I encouraged everyone to voice their thoughts.

**R - Result**
Members of both teams appreciated being heard and involved in decision-making. The resulting navigation design struck a good balance of style and substance, and this collaborative approach avoided delays and helped build trust between the teams, making future interactions smoother.
# High-Level Technical Questions
## Describe the steps you and your team would take to design an API

**Determining needs:**
- I would first understand the user and business needs - in the HMCTS context taking extra precautions in areas such as data sensitivity and accessibility.
- We could use stakeholder meetings and workshops to define the core functionality and identify consumers of the API.
- Make sure the understand the differences between the consumers of the API - some may be internal like case management tools, whereas some may be external like legal firms.

**Drafting a specification:**
- We'd draft a specfication using a standard such as OpenAPI
- Ensuring the design is clear, versioned, and well-documented.
- We'd follow RESTful principles and HMCTS coding standards
- As well and prioritising consistency, clear resource naming, and meaningful status codes.

**Security as a core step:**
- We would treat security as a first-order principle, considering authentication (for example using OAuth 2.0), input validation, audit logging from the start aligning with HMCTS security guidelines.
- OAuth 2.0 differs from how I usually roll auth - a user logs into a different service (e.g. google or facebook) and gives that service permission to issue your app a limited-access token to use their data on that other service, all without your app ever seeing their password for that service.
- This allows you to utilise the robust security  infrastructure of big tech companies for authentication and authorisation.

**Review and implementation:**
- We'd review the design with technical leads and security architects
- Then implement iteratively with thorough automated tests (using tools such as Postman to conduct API requests) and contract testing (using tools like Dredd that asserts responses based on your OpenAPI spec). 

## How do you approach building secure applications

Building secure applications starts with an approach that emphasises security by way of design (*secure by design*) rather than as a bandage or afterthought. Especially in an organisation like HMCTS that handles sensitive date, it's crucial to follow security practices and I've had a bit of a look over HMCTS standards and the GOV.UK Service Manual so I would consult those resources.

There is a list of the top 10 vulnerabilities in web applications known as OWASP Top Ten. Some of the ones that I can remember off the top of my head are Broken Access Control (which is number 1) - referring to when authorisation isn't implemented properly and an attacker gains access to resources or actions they shouldn't be able to. 

1. Broken Access Control
		- What is it: Users can access resources or perform actions they aren't authorised to
		- Example: Giving the admin panel to regular users.
		- Prevention: Deny access by default, require an access token for everything, principle of least privilege, and conduct thorough testing
2. Cryptographic Failures
		- What is it: Data exposure or system compromise due to cryptographic issues such as weak encryption algorithms, improper key management, or failure to encrypt sensitive data when necessary
		- Example: Storing data in plain text, using outdated or weak algorithms (SHA-256 weak, bcrypt better, Argon2 best)
		- MD5 -> SHA-1 -> PBKDF2 -> bcrypt -> scrypt -> Argon2
		- Prevention: Use strong industry standard algorithms, securely manage encryption keys (what you put in .env during dev, but should put in cloud providers like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault), ensure all sensitive data is encrypted
3. Injection
		- What is it: When data is sent as part of a query, tricking the interpreter into executing an unintended command or accessing unathorised data.
		- Examples: SQL Injection, XSS Attacks
		- Prevention: Use sage APIs that avoid the interpreter (use parameterised queries that tread user input as a literal string), espace special characters, validate inputs.

There are automated security testing tools such as SonarQube and OWASP ZAP. It's also important to check for vulnerabilities in you dependencies using something like npm audit for a node.js app or dependabot.

Security reviews a part of the workflow, I flag risks where needed, and ensure that any logs or error handling doesn't expose internal logic. I also treat security as a shared team responsibility, collaborating with testers and architects to assess threat models and make sure we're compliant with information assurance standards.
## What's your approach in documenting your code?

I aim to write clear and self-explanatory code, ensuring that variable and method names are as intuitive as possible, which acts as a sort of documentation in and of itself. I follow my own particular naming conventions but I understand that HMRC has a style that I would adhere to in that context. I keep code chunks limited, for example functions should only be a few lines long, and the code should be modular so that someone new to the project, or myself in the future, can understand what's going on without digging too deeply.

For any complex logic I add comments where I think it will be helpful, especially when I need to explain why I've done something as opposed to just what I've done, which should be covered by the naming.

I create REAME files, API specifications or wikis depending on what the team uses. I know that HMCTS uses OpenAPI for example so I would be adhering to those standards when writing API specs.

Overall I treat good documentation and a key part of writing production-quality software.
## What do you know about CI/CD

I understand CI/CD as a way to make softer development faster, safer, and more reliable. CI stands for Continuous Integration, which means devs push small changes often to the codebase. Every time coed is pushed, automated tests run the check that nothing has been broken by the new code. 

CD stands for continuous delivery, which means that once the code passes all tests, it can be automatically released to a live environment. You can use tools like Jenkins to manage this process as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

I've worked on projects where I've used GitHub actions for basic CI, like running tests on pull requests. And I understand that CI/CD helps teams release updates more often and with more confidence which of course is especially important in crucial sectors like the justice system where stability and trust are critical.

I'm keep to build more of an understanding and contribute to a secure and efficient CI/CD setup.
## You discovered a security vulnerability for an urgent task shortly before presenting to stakeholders. What's your approach to solving the problem?

## What legal or compliance issues should be considered when handling data in HMCTS systems?

There are of course several legal and compliance obligations that need to be taken into account due to the sensitive nature of court and tribunal data. The fundamental set of laws to note is the Data Protection Act 2018 (plus UK GDPR). These set out the rules around processing, data minimisation, purpose limitation, and the rights of data subjects. Developers to to ensure data in collected and retained when necessary, only for its intended purpose, and stored securely with time limits.

There are other legal matters to be aware of such as the Government Security Classifications Policy, which requires certain data to be handled with encryption in transit and at rest.

In practice this means strong access controls, auditing data access, avoiding sensitive data being logged or appearing in error messages. Systems should also be designed to adhere to data retention policies and data deletion workflows.

Working in DTS means aligning with **MoJ and HMCTS information assurance frameworks**, and regularly collaborating with security and legal teams to ensure our systems not only meet functional needs but uphold the highest legal and ethical standards.
## Have you previously worked in an agile team? Can you describe your way of working?

Yes, I've worked in agile teams. For example during a hackathon at Digital Futures where we build a full stack app to help businesses assess different LLMs. I was the frontend lead, working closely with a team that included data analysts and a backend developer.

We followed agile principles throughout, using a kanban board to manage our tasks, writing user stories to reflect how our app would be used, and breaking them down into manageable tickets. Each morning we had short stand-ups to share progress and blockers. I took ownership of delivering a clean and modern UI using Next.js and ShadcnUI, but made sure to stay aligned with the rest of the team by reviewing backend API contracts and giving feedback on integration points.

My way of working is collaborative, transparent and iterative. I like to push small changes often, gather feedback ealy, and stay flexible when priorities shift, which is crucial in agile delivery. I'm comfortable adapting to evolving requirements and always keep the end use at the centre of the process.

## What is agile?

Agile is the standard way of working in most software development teams nowadays because it helps deliver working software quickly and is highly adaptable to change. It's based on principles like iterative delivery, collaboration, and continuous improvement, all of which are key to building effectively.

In an agile team, work is organised into a product backlog which is a prioritised list of user needs often written as user stories. Work is split into sprints, which usually run for two weeks, and there are stand-ups every day to keep communication open, where agile team members share what we did, what we're going to do next, and if we have any blockers.

At HMCTS the end user is critical, so getting feedback early and often is a big part of why agile is effective. After each spring, a retrospective is held to reflect on what went well and how things can be improved. We also hold spring reviews to demonstrate what we've built to stakeholders.

In agile teams that I've worked in so far, we've used tools like kanban boards, estimated effort for each user story together with my team, and adapted the backlog when priorities changed. It created a shared sense of responsibility and aligns well with the values set out in the civil service website and what I've read in the HMCTS.

## What would you do if you didn’t know how to solve a technical task during the pairing exercise? (This isn't for an answer to their question)

The first thing I would do, after having had a go at it and not getting anywhere in a reasonable amount of time, would be to be honest about it with another member of the team. I'd try to explain my desired result, what I've already done to achieve it, and give any error messages or logs that I'm getting. 

I would try to talk through the problem, breaking it down into smaller pieces, asking questions, checking assumptions, and exploring possible approaches together. I would actively listen and treat it as a learning opportunity. If we're both stuck, I would consult documentation or other online resources. 

My goal the whole time would be to stay calm, not get frustrated, and show that I'm resourceful and eager to learn, which matters more than always having the answer on the spot.

## How do you approach testing?

I see testing as an essential part of writing reliable, maintainable software — not something separate from development. My approach starts with **writing clean, testable code**: small, well-named functions that do one thing clearly. This makes it easier to apply **unit testing**, which I usually do first to check that individual components or functions behave as expected.

Depending on the stack, I’ve used tools like **Vitest** for JavaScript, **Pytest** for Python, and **JUnit** for Java. In full-stack projects, I also write **integration tests** to check how different parts of the system work together — for example, making sure the frontend properly calls backend APIs and handles responses.

In an agile team, testing is part of **continuous integration (CI)** — so I write tests early, run them often, and make sure they’re part of the pipeline using tools like **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**, which is used at HMCTS DTS. I also believe in writing **meaningful test cases**, not just for coverage but to reflect real user behaviour.

Finally, I aim to get feedback fast — from tests, teammates, and users — so that bugs don’t pile up later. Good testing gives you the confidence to change code safely, which is essential in public sector systems that real people depend on.

## How do you follow modern coding standards when developing software?

I write clean, readable code that adheres to language-specific best practices and styling. Specifically that means consistent and correct indentation, naming conventions, capitalisation, cases, keeping functions small, and avoiding deeply nested logic. I use linters like Prettier to enforce this automatically.

I write testable code, using TDD where I think it's suitable, meaning that I separate concerns, and write unit tests before code, and I write integration tests to ensure different parts of the code work together as intended.

In terms of collaboration I try to use Git effectively by committing actively and often, with well-written commit messages, and I contribute to documentation such as in the form of a README. If I'm building an API I stick to RESTful standards.

Finally, I'm always open to feedback, and try to stay up-to-date with best practices and reflect on how my code can better serve both the team and the end users.
## How would your scale an application?

I would take a look at both vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical meaning improving the performance of a single server, for example by giving it more memory or CPU. But since HMCTS DTS focuses on cloud-native applications, I'd mostly focus on horizontal scaling by adding more instances of the app to handle increased load.

I could use kubernetes or docker, although I'm not well-versed in these tools, but I know that I could deploy multiple containers across nodes and kubernetes can automatically scale them based on traffic.

I would also pay attention to the database layer. Perhaps I could use caching with redis for example. As a junior developer, scaling is something I need to learn a lot more about and I'd like to learn from architects and ops engineers.
