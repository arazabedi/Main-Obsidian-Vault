- Handling highly sensitive personal, legal, and sometimes criminal information imposes stringent obligations in the legal, regulatory, and ethical spheres.
- This is important to avoid legal troubles and maintain public trust in the justice system.

- First is UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 - which define how personal data must be collected, stored, processed, and shared.
- You need a lawful basis for processing, plus additional conditions for handling such data.
- Data minimisation, purpose limitation, and storage limitation are key principles here.

- Second is information security compliance.
- HMCTS systems must meet the Government's Security Policy Framework (SPF) and Cyber Essentials Plus - strong authentication, access controls, audit trails.
- All data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest using government- approved standards (e.g. TLS 1.2+, AES-256)
- Access should follow least privilege and role-based access control

- Be aware of common law confidentiality affecting how data can be accessed or discloses to third parties.
- Systems may fall under the **Public Sector Network (PSN)** or **Official-Sensitive** data handling classifications, which dictate operational controls, hosting requirements, and audit responsibilities.
- Finally, any new processing activity should undergo a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**. And if you're designing new systems, **privacy by design and by default** is a legal requirement—not a best practice.
- In short: compliance in HMCTS isn’t just box-ticking - it’s deeply interwoven with technical design, system architecture, and user access. You’re operating under one of the strictest public-sector data regimes in the UK.
