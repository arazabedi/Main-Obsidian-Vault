Testing conducted after a code update to ensure that the update introduces no new bugs.

QA teams have regression test cases for important features that they execute every time code is changed.

Regression testing makes it easy to locate the exact component that produces the bug.

It's like a health check-up.

Regression testing is a style of automation testing.

Basically:

1. Develop a feature and a test to check the code works.
2. Use that test on a later update.

Regression testing is important in Agile and CI/CD!

CI/CD is just a series of automated tests!

Agile is about continuously iterating, integrating, and testing code.

Continuous testing is KEY to Agile development success. 

It occurs parallel to software development, not after sprint completion.

In agile, testing in an activity, not a role. Everyone shares responsibility of meeting goals on quality assurance. There is a lot of collaboration.

Job descriptions describe specialisations for testers and developers, but the whole team strives for the same goal. Therefore testers validate user stories and define acceptance criteria, join daily meeting stand-ups, do exploratory and regression testing, and do both automated and manual testing.

**Exploratory Testing**
- Manually testing something based on intuition
- Flexible
- Doesn't need a test-plan
- Finds defects that other tests can't find
