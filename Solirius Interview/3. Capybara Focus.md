Methods (cheat sheet):
https://gist.github.com/alexbrinkman/cc4bc502b06bf08bd079

Capybara is a DSL that comes with built in methods that allow you to:

```ruby
# Capybara Methods
visit #  a page
fill_in # a textbox
click_button
click_link
check # a checkbox
choose # a radio button
select # a dropdown
within # search a section
have_content # check if a page has some content
```

Capybara works with Ruby.

The course covers:

1. Capybara installation
2. Chrome Dev Tools to find locators for web elements
3. RSPEC
4. Interacting with Login Pages
5. Extending the wait time for slow loading components
6. Dealing with Modals and Popups which need to be accepted, canceled, or okayed
7. Running browser tests in Chrome and FireFox, both in regular and headless mode.

And and advanced topics:
1. Capturing screenshots
2. Setup Chrome with Logging
3. Running tests in Capybara's new Apparition driver
4. Combining Applitools Eyes with Capybara to perform Visual Testing

# 1. Installation etc.



In all spec files, add 'spec' to the end of the name (not a file extension - for example visit_home_spec). This is for rspec to know what it is.

Each spec describes a feature of capybara (in the prepared files).

How capybara should be set up and which web driver to use (this can go in individual spec files, or just one file called spec_helper which you can require in all the spec files):

1. We need bundler, the capybara dsl (to interact with the test site), and rspec for tests.
2. Tell bundler to setup and require the default gems for the current environment
3. Setup the default driver (Selenium this time)
4. Configure RSPEC to print details to the screen on test completion

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'bundler'
require 'capybara/dsl'
require 'capybara/rspec'

Bundler.setup(:default)
Bundler.require

# Which default browser do you want Selenium WebDriver to use?
# :selenium_chrome # Selenium driving Chrome
# :selenium_chrome_headless # Selenium driving Chrome in a headless configuration
# https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#selenium

Capybara.default_driver = :selenium_chrome
Capybara.app_host = 'https://the-internet.herokuapp.com'
Capybara.default_max_wait_time = 10

# Run using:
# bundle exec rspec spec/features/login.rb --format documentation
# ... Or...

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.formatter = :documentation
end

```
# 2. Tests
## 2.1 What's In a Test? Arrange, Act, Assert
Testing Pattern:
1. **Arrange** - preconditions and inputs 
2. **Act** - on the object or method under test
3. **Assert** - that the expected result has occured

Arrange - Navigate to the area to be tested and find the web element being interacted with (e.g. textbox, dropdown etc.).

Act - Fill the textbox, select a value from the dropdown etc.

Assert - Did the value match the expected value, did the correct user prompts appear?

RSpec allows you to describe the features you're testing by listing the various scenario. 

Capybara works with the capybara/rspec lbrary to create descriptive acceptance tests.

In practice, RSpec and Cucumber are often used together. RSpec is used for lower-level testing (e.g. unity and integration testing), while Cucumber is used for high-level, feature-level tests to ensure an application meets its intended requirements. It looks like in this course we will just use RSpec.

A ***feature*** is an actual feature of a web app.

1. Each specific test contains a ***background*** detailing what page to go to etc.
2. And a ***scenario*** detailing each step that needs to be carried out.
3. Finally the ***expect*** method which asserts a match between expected and actual value. If the values don't match then the test fails.

- Feature
	- Background
	- Scenario
	- Expect

Here's an example of the way that Arrange, Act, Assert works with this stack:

```ruby
feature 'Visit The-Internet Home Page' do
  background do
    visit '/'
  end

  scenario 'Title: Welcome to the-internet' do
    expect(page).to have_content('Welcome to the-internet')
    expect(page).to have_css('h1', text: 'Welcome to the-internet')
  end
end
```

We 
## 2.2 Testing Headers, Current URL, and Links

We need to confirm that we're on the correct page by:
- Checking that a particular link exists
- That the title is correct
- Making sure that a link goes to the right place
- Check that there exists a specific tag with specific text
- etc...

Try to be specific (use `have_css` for example).

Always check that drop-downs and text-boxes etc. exist because front-end frameworks (e.g. React) render them slowly.

## 2.3 Navigation - Visit Page and Expect Headings

```ruby
visit('') # goes to config.app_host in spec_helper.rb
go_back
go_forward
refresh
click_link
```

Background is run before scenario in order to setup the test.


## 2.3 Searching Within an Section



```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

feature 'Within: Scoping' do
  background do
    visit '/checkboxes'
  end

  scenario 'Within (Checkboxes): checkbox 1' do
    within('form#checkboxes') do
      expect(page).to have_content('checkbox 1')
    end
  end

  scenario 'Within (Checkboxes): checkbox 2' do
    within('form#checkboxes') do
      expect(page).to have_content('checkbox 2')
    end
  end
end

```

# 3 Finders & Matchers
## 3.1 Finders

https://rubydoc.info/github/teamcapybara/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Finders

```ruby
find_field('First Name').value
find_field(id: 'my_field').value
find_link('Hello', :visible => :all).visible?
find_link(class: ['some_class', 'some_other_class'], :visible => :all).visible?

find_button('Send').click
find_button(value: '1234').click

find(:xpath, ".//table/tr").click
find("#overlay").find("h1").click
all('a').each { |a| a[:href] }
```

## 3.2 Matchers

```ruby
click_link("Password") # also matches "Password confirmation"
Capybara.exact = true
click_link("Password") # does not match "Password confirmation"
click_link("Password", exact: false) # can be overridden
```

You can use Capybara.exact to determine whether a match needs to be exact or not. Set it to false to allow substring matches. You can also override it in parameters as seen above.

# 4. Testing GUI components

## 4.1/4.2 Login Test and Storing Commonly Used Steps in Methods

```ruby
def login(username, password)
  fill_in('Username', with: username)
  fill_in('Password', with: password)
  click_button('Login')
  expect(page).to have_css('h2', text: 'Secure Area')
end
```

You can now use the login method instead of copy pasting the whole thing.

# 5/6 Dropdowns, Radios, Checkboxes, Modals, and Alerts

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

feature 'Dropdown List: Validate Page Elements' do
  background do
    visit '/dropdown'
  end

  scenario 'Displayed Title: Dropdown List' do
    expect(page).to have_css('h3', text: 'Dropdown List')
  end
end

feature 'Dropdown List: Switching Values' do
  background do
    visit '/dropdown'
  end

  scenario 'Default Value: Please select an option' do
    expect(page).to have_select('dropdown', selected: 'Please select an option')
  end

  scenario 'Switched to: Option 1' do
    select('Option 1', :from => 'dropdown')
    expect(page).to have_select('dropdown', selected: 'Option 1')
  end

  scenario 'Switched to: Option 2' do
    select('Option 2', :from => 'dropdown')
    expect(page).to have_select('dropdown', selected: 'Option 2')
  end
end

```

```ruby
MODAL_METHODS = [ :accept_alert, :accept_confirm, :dismiss_confirm, :accept_prompt, :dismiss_prompt ]
```

# 7 Chromedriver

## 7.1 Screenshots and HTML Snapshots

```ruby
save_page
save_and_open_page # Requires the launchy gem 
save_screenshot("screenshot.png")
save_and_open_screenshot
```

Saves in temp folder.

Save and open I believe saves HTML and open an unstyled version of the page.

## 7.2 Logging and Headless Chrome

See files

## 7.3 Apparition

See status codes (e.g. 200, 404), response headings, screenshots etc.

Chrome has headless mode.

Apparition allows you to communicate with Chrome without using chromedriver. You can run tests in headless or headed mode.

It communicates with Chrome using _Chrome_Â DevTools Protocol (CDP).

```ruby]
# spec_helper.rb
Capybara.default_driver = :apparition
Capybara.javascript_driver = :apparition
```

https://github.com/twalpole/apparition

Prob old.

Features:

```
- `page.status_code`
- `page.response_headers`
- `page.driver.render_base64(format, options)`
- `page.driver.scroll_to(left, top)`
- `page.driver.basic_authorize(user, password)`
- `page.driver.set_proxy(host, port, type, user, password, bypass: [bypass list passed to chrome])`
- cookie handling
- extra headers
```

And more (see site).

## 7.4 Visual Testing - Applitools + Capybara

Capybara is great for functional and acceptance testing.

But what if you want to check that the actual web element meets the acceptance criteria?

You would have to write soooo many tests.

Applitools allows you to take screenshots as the app is running and fine-tune areas you want to focus on etc...
