# Parse String into Number
- Use `Number()` for general conversion (especially with simple number-like strings).
- Use `parseInt()` when you need an integer and might have strings with different bases.
- Use `parseFloat()` when you need a floating-point number and might have strings with different bases.
- Use the `+` operator cautiously, as it might lead to unexpected behavior with non-numeric strings.
