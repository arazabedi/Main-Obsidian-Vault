##### Console

Cmd+Opt+J - Open Chrome dev tools on the console tab

To insert multiple lines in the console, press Shift+Enter. This way one can enter long fragments of JavaScript code.

##### Alert

```
alert( 'Hello, world!' );
```

##### Script Tag in HTML

You can add a path or a url to s script tag in order to use an external script.

```<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>```

```<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>```

##### Code Structure

Statements such as the alert statement above perform actions.

Semicolons may be ommitted in many cases but sometimes JS will fail to assume a line-break which can cause errors.

##### Comments

Single-line: Anything after `//` on a line is commented out. ``

Multi-line: `/* … */`

##### Use Strict

The `use strict` directive indicates that the code should be exectued in 'strict mode'.

Strict mode shoul dbe declared at the beginning of a script or function.

Classes and Modules enable `use strict` automatically.

##### Variables

A [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) is a “named storage” for data.

Delcare a variable and store data inside it with:

```js
let message = 'Hello!';
console.log(message);
```

You can re-assign 'let' variables, but you can't redeclare them.

##### Constants

A variable declared with const cannot be re-assigned. The below runs with a type error.

```js
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
myBirthday = "20.04.2002"
console.log(myBirthday);
```

##### Upper Case Constants

For constants that are known prior to runtime, use upper-case and underscores.

`const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

##### Data Types

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

1.  ***Number*** for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point,  integers are limited by `±(253-1)`.
2.  ***Bigint*** for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
3.  ***String*** for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4.  ***Boolean*** for `true`/`false`.
5.  ***Null*** for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value `null`.
6.  ***Undefined*** for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value `undefined`.
7.  ***Symbol*** for unique identifiers.
8.  ***Object*** for more complex data structures (Ruby hashes).

##### String Interpolation

You can embed variables and expressions into strings using backticks and ${}:

```js
let name = "John";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
console.log(`The result is ${1+2}`);
```

##### The Typeof Operator

```javascript
console.log(typeof "true")
```

##### Modals

Alert - `alert("Hello");`

Prompt - `prompt(title, '');` *The empty string as the second argument is the initial value in the input field*

```js
let age = prompt('How old are you?', 100); 
alert(`You are ${age} years old!`);
```

Confirm - `result = confirm(question);`

```js
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?"); 
alert( isBoss );
```

##### Type Conversions

Add a function or expression to the brackets to convert into the named type.

1. `String()`

2. `Number()`

| Value      | Becomes |
| ---------- | ------- |
| undefined  | NaN     |
| null       | 0       |
| true/false | 1/0     |
| string     |    Whitespaces (includes spaces, tabs `\t`, newlines `\n` etc.) from the start and end are removed. If the remaining string is empty, the result is `0`. Otherwise, the number is “read” from the string. An error gives `NaN`.     |

3. `Boolean()`

| Value                                                | Become |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `0`, an empty string, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` | false  |
| Other values                                         | true   | |

*Note that the string "0" is true.

##### Basic Operators

- Addition `+`,
- Subtraction `-`,
- Multiplication `*`,
- Division `/`,
- Remainder `%`,
- Exponentiation `**`.

If the plus operator is used on a string then it concatenates (merges) the two operands:

```js
console.log( 2 + '1' ); //21
console.log(2 + 2 + '1' ); //41
console.log('1' + 2 + 2); //122
```

*Note that if either operand is a string then concatenation will occur, but numerical addition will take place prior to concatenation in the second example due to BODMAS. In the third example, the whole expression is concatenated, as the string '1' comes first.

___
**Unary Plus**

The plus operator applied to a single value (unary plus) converts non-numbers into numbers:

```js
console.log( +true ); //1
console.log( +"" ); // 0
```

The unary plus is used as short-form for `Number()`:

```js
let apples = "2"; let oranges = "3"; // both values converted to numbers before the binary plus 
console.log( +apples + +oranges ); // 5
// the longer variant //
console.log( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5
```
*Unary pluses have higher precedence than binary pluses and are therefore applied to values first*

You can override precedence using brackets.

___
**Assignment**

Assignment (the use of the = operator) returns a value. `a = b + 1` in the below code block returns `3`, therefore `c = 3 - 3` and on execution `c = 0`.

```js
let a = 1; 
let b = 2; 
let c = 3 - (a = b + 1);
console.log(c)
```

*This is not clear code and should be avoided*

___
**Chaining Assignments**

Chained assignments are evaluated from right to left.

```js
let a, b, c; a = b = c = 2 + 2;
console.log(a, b, c)
```

For clarity, use the below syntax:

```js
c = 2 + 2; 
b = c; 
a = c;
console.log(a, b, c)
```

___
**Modify-in-place**

In order to apply an operator to a variable and store the new data in that same variable, use the following notation:

`operator + =`

For example:

```js
let n = 2
n += 5 // 7
n *= 2 // 14
console.log(n)
```

This short “modify-and-assign” notation exists for all arithmetical and bitwise operators: `/=`, `-=`, etc. They have the same precedence as normal assignment so they run after most other calculations.

___
**Increment/Decrement**

`++` is the same as `variable + 1`
`--` is the same as `variable - 1`

As a prefix, this notation returns the new value. As a postfix, it will return the original value. The variable itself is assigned the new value.

___
**Bitwise Operators**

-   AND ( `&` )
-   OR ( `|` )
-   XOR ( `^` )
-   NOT ( `~` )
-   LEFT SHIFT ( `<<` )
-   RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>` )
-   ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( `>>>` )

___
**Comma**

You can use commas to separate out several actions while keeping them on the same line. The last action is the one that will be returned.

The expression `1 + 2` in the below code block is thrown away.

```js
let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
console.log(a)
```

Commas are used mainly in JavaScript frameworks, but don't improve code readabilty so should be avoided if possible.

##### Comparisons

Mathematical operators such as  `<`, `>`, `==`, and`!=` return booleans.

```js
console.log(3 > 2) // true
console.log(6 < 9) // true
console.log(10 == 10) // true
console.log(3 != 4) // true
```

___

**String Comparison**

The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:

1.  Compare the first character of both strings.
2.  If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done.
3.  Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way.
4.  Repeat until the end of either string.
5.  If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater.

```js
console.log( 'Z' > 'A' ); //true 
console.log( 'Glow' > 'Glee' ); // true 
console.log( 'Bee' > 'Be' ); // true
```

*The algorithm uses Unicode order, therefore lowercase is greater than uppercase

JavaScript converts values of different types to numbers:

```js
console.log( '2' > 1 ); // true, string '2' becomes a number 2 
console.log( '01' == 1 ); // true, string '01' becomes a number 1
```

Booleans are converted to binary:

```js
console.log( true == 1 ); // true 
console.log( false == 0 ); // true
```

**Strict Equality**

`==` cannt differentiate between `0` and `false`, or `''` and `false` because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator `==`. 

```js
0 == false // true
'' == false // true
```

The strict equality operator `===` checks the equality without type conversion, therefore if `a` and `b` are of different types then it returns `false`.

```js
console.log(0 === false); // false
```

There is also a strict non-equality operator `!==` analogous to `!=`.

**Comparison with null and undefined**

```js
console.log(null === undefined); // false
console.log(null == undefined); // true
```

For maths and other comparisons, `null` becomes `0`, while `undefined` becomes `NaN`.

```js
console.log( null > 0 ); // (1) false 
console.log( null == 0 ); // (2) false 
console.log( null >= 0 ); // (3) true
```

**An incomparable undefined**

The value `undefined` shouldn’t be compared to other values:

```js
console.log( undefined > 0 ); // false (1) 
console.log( undefined < 0 ); // false (2) 
console.log( undefined == 0 ); // false (3)
```

The first two comparisons return `false` because `undefined` gets converted to `NaN` which returns false for all comparisons. The third check returns `false` because `undefined` only equals `null` and `undefined`.

*JavaScript has many quirks*

**Avoid Problems**

-   Treat any comparison with `undefined/null` except the strict equality `===` with exceptional care.
-   Don’t use comparisons `>= > < <=` with a variable which may be `null/undefined`, unless you’re really sure of what you’re doing. If a variable can have these values, check for them separately.

##### Conditional Branching

1. One statement:

```js
if ( 2 > 1 ) console.log( 'Two is greater than one' );
```

2. Multiple statements:

```js
year = 2022
if (year == 2022) { 
	console.log( "That's correct!" );
	console.log( "You're so smart!" ); 
}
```

*Always wrap code blocks in curly braces to improve readibility*

3. Multiple conditions:

```js
let year = 2022; 
if (year < 2015) { 
	console.log( 'Too early...' ); 
} else if (year > 2015) { 
	console.log( 'Too late' ); 
} else { 
	console.log( 'Exactly!' ); 
}
```

4. Ternary operator:

```js
let age = 19
let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;
console.log(accessAllowed);
```

*The parentheses around `age > 18` is not technically necessary but helps with code readability*. You can also technically ommitt the ternary operator as `age > 18` returns true on its own.

5. Multiple conditions with `?`:

Use multiple `:` symbols to entend a ternary operation so that it has multiple conditions. 

```js
let age = 18; 
let message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' : 
	(age < 18) ? 'Hello!' : 
	(age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' : 'What an unusual age!'; 
	
console.log( message );
```

*This is a different way of writing out elsif and else*

**`?` instead of `if`**

```js
250 < 300 ? console.log('correct') : '' // correct
```

*It is advisable not to use `?` for code execution as it is not readable due to the verticality of human reading. Stick to if-elsif-else for execution of different branches of code, and use `?` for returns (usually for assignment) *

##### Logical Operators

- `||` (OR)
- `&&` (AND)
- `!` (NOT)
- `??` (NULLING COALESCING)

___
**OR ( || )**

1. Two operands:
	The JS OR operator is inclusive. It only returns false if both operands are false.

```js
console.log(2===2 || 3===3); // true
```

2. Three or more operands:
	Evaluates operands from left to right, converting each to a boolean. If the result is true, the operator stops and returns the original value of that operand. If all operands were false, it returns the last operand

```js
console.log( 1 || 0 ); // 1 (1 is truthy)

console.log( null || 1 ); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)

console.log( null || 0 || 1 ); // 1 (the first truthy value)

console.log( undefined || null || 0 ); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)
```

The `OR` operator is thus useful for returning the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions. It is also useful for executing commands at particular points as seen below:


```js
true || console.log("not printed");

false || console.log("printed");

// printed
```

*Only the second `console.log` string will print as the first is ignored given that the `OR` operator stops at the first truthy value - in this case the boolean `true` on the first line of code.*

___
**AND ( && )**

1. Two operands:
	`&&` only returns true if both operands are true.

```js
console.log("1" && 2===2); //true

console.log("" && 3===1); // empty string returned

console.log ("hello world" && 3 < 2) //false
```

2. Three or more operands:
	-  Evaluates operands from left to right.
	-  For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is `false`, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
	-  If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.

*In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.*

*The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first _falsy_ value while OR returns the first _truthy_ one.*

```js
// if the first operand is truthy, 
// AND returns the second operand: 
console.log( 1 && 0 ); // 0 
console.log( 1 && 5 ); // 5 

// if the first operand is falsy, 
// AND returns it. The second operand is ignored 
console.log( null && 5 ); // null 
console.log( 0 && "no matter what" ); // 0
```

We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:

```js
console.log( 1 && 2 && null && 3 ); // null
```

When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:

```js
console.log( 1 && 2 && 3 ); // 3, the last one
```


>[!todo] info 
AND (&&) Precedence is higher than OR (||)

>[!warning]
>Don’t replace `if` with `||` or `&&`
>
>It is technically possible to use `&&` instead of `if` because if the first operand is true then the second operand will be returned. However this is not very readable.
>
>```js
>let x = 1;
>(x > 0) && console.log('Greater than zero!');

___
**NOT ( ! )**

The operator `!` converts the operand to the boolean type then returns the inverse value.

```js
console.log(!true); //false
console.log(!0); //true
```

A double NOT `!!` can be used to convert a value to a boolean type:

```js
console.log(!!"non-empty-string"); //true
console.log(!!null); //false
```

*This works because the first NOT is reversed by the second, while the boolean conversion remains in place.*

This is a less verbose way of using the `Boolean` function:

```js
console.log(Boolean("non-empty-string")); //true
console.log(Boolean(null)); //false
```

>[!info]
>NOT `!` has higher precedence than all other logical operators

>[!tldr]
>1. `NOT` executes before `AND` which executes before `OR`
>2. `OR` returns the first truthy value or if all were falsy, then the last value
>3. `AND` returns the first falsy value, or if all were truthy , then the last value
>4. `NOT` returns the inverse of a value's boolean
>

##### Nullish Coalescing Operator

If a value is neither `null` or `undefined` then it is `defined`.

We will use the following expression:

```js
a ?? b
```

If `a` is defined, `a ?? b` returns the value of `a`:

```js
let a = 3
console.log(a ?? b) //3
```

if a isn't defined, the the value of b is returned:

```js
let a = null
let b = 5
console.log(a ?? b) //5
```

*The `??` operator* returns the first defined value. It also works with more than two operands.

>[!info]
>`??` is very similar to `||`:
>- `||` returns the first `truthy` value
>- `??` returns the first `defined` value (anything but `null` or `undefined`)

>[!tip]
>`??` is very useful in scenarios where 0 is a valid value

*`??` and `||`  both have the same precedence so you must include parentheses for any operands that contain an operator :*

```js
// without parentheses 
let area = height ?? 100 * width ?? 50;

// ...works this way (not what we want): 
let area = height ?? (100 * width) ?? 50;
```

You cannot use `??` together with `&&` and `||` unless you use explicit parentheses:

```js
let x = 1 && 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error
```

```js
let x = (1 && 2) ?? 3; // Works
console.log(x); // 2
```

##### Loops: `While` and `For`

**While Loop**
___
```js
while (condition) { 
	// code 
	// so-called "loop body" 
} 
```

While the condition is `truthy`, the code from the loop body  is executed.

```js
let i = 0;
while (i<3) {
	console.log(i);
	i++;
}
```
*Without `i++` this would be an infinite loop*

Any expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just a comparison as `while` converts these to a boolean.

> [!example] 
> ```js
> while ( i != 0) == while (i) 
> ```

> [!info] 
> Curly braces are not required for a single-line body
> > [!example] 
> ```js
> let i = 3;
> while (i) console.log(i--)
> ```

**Do...While Loop** 
___
You can re-organise the syntax for a while loop so that the condition is moved below the loop body. This will:

	1. Execute the loop body.
	2. If the condition is truthy, re-execute the loop body
	otherwise if the condition is falsy, stop.

```js
do { 
// loop body 
} while (condition);
```

*This syntax should only be used when you want the loop body to be executed at least once regardless of the condition being met*

**For Loop**
___
Similarly to `while` loops, `for` allows you to iterate over a collection. Sometimes `while` is a little clearer as there is usually a more definite number of iterations and the loop execution steps are more readable.

	1. Executes `begin`
	2. If `condition` is truthy, move to step 3, else stop
	3. Run `body`
	4. run `step`
	5. Go back to step 2

```js
for (begin; condition; step) { 
// ... loop body ... 
}
```

For example:

	1. `let i = 0`
	2. i = 0 therefore `i < 3` is truthy
	3. Run console.log(0) //0
	4. Run i++ so i = 1
	5. Re-check condition and run body & step
	6. When i = 3 stop the loop

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
console.log(i); 
}
// shows 0, then 1, then 2
```

*You can also define a variable outside the for loop, which would allow you to use that variable outside the loop for some other purpose. Inline variable declaration is only visible inside the loop and cannot be used outside it*

Any part of a `for` loop can be skipped. Just don't put anything before the semic-colons.

```js
for (;;) { 
// repeats without limits 
}
```

*An infinite loop*

**Breaking the Loop**
___
You can force exit from a loop using the `break` directive

```js
let sum = 0; 
while (true) { 
	let value = +prompt("Enter a number", '');
	if (!value) break; // (*)
	sum += value; 
} 
alert( 'Sum: ' + sum );
```

The `break` directive is activated at the line `(*)` if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately, passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, `alert`.

The combination “infinite loop + `break` as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s condition must be checked not in the beginning or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.

**Continue to the Next Iteration**
___
The `Continue` directive allows you to skip running the body and start at the top of the loop if the condition allows.

The loop below uses `continue` to output only odd values:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
// if true, skip the remaining part of the body 
	if (i % 2 == 0) continue;
	console.log(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9 
}
```

For even values of `i`, the `continue` directive stops executing the body and passes control to the next iteration of `for` (with the next number). So the `console.log` is only called for odd values.

> [!warning] 
> `break` and `continue` don't work with a ternary operator. Use if in most cases to avoid syntax errors. Ternary operators only allow expressions.

**Labels for `break` and `continue`**
___
A `label` is an identifier with a colon before a loop:

```js
labelName: for (...) {
	...
}
```

The `break <labelName>` statement in the loop breaks out to the label. This is useful for nested loops, so that you can reach the outer loop through an inner loop.

You can also use the following syntax:

```js
outer: 
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { ... }
```

*The label can go on a separate line above the for loop*

> [!warning] 
> You cannot use labels to jump to any place you want in the code. For example you cannot use it to skip over some lines in place of an if statement. They are only used for breaking out of a loop (`break`) or skipping a particular iteration (`continue`).

> [!info] 
> A `break` directive can go inside any code block, but a `continue` is only possible inside a loop
> 

##### The "Switch" Statement

A `switch` statement can replace multiple `if` checks.

It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.

1. The value of `x` is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first `case` (that is, `value1`) then to the second (`value2`) and so on.
2. If the equality is found, `switch` starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding `case`, until the nearest `break` (or until the end of `switch`).
3. If no case is matched then the `default` code is executed (if it exists)

```js
switch(x) { 
	case 'value1': // if (x === 'value1')
	...
	break
	
	case 'value2': // if (x === 'value2')
	...
	break
	
	default:
	...
	break
}
```

You can group cases together:

```js
case 3:
case 5: 
	alert('Wrong!'); 
	alert("Why don't you take a math class?"); 
break;
```

*This works because `case 3` executes and goes through `case 5` because there's no `break` in-beween them

> [!warning] 
> The equality check is always strict so the `type` must match.
> 

##### Functions

**Function Declaration**
___
**We create a function using a function declaration:**

```js
function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) {
	// body 
}
```

> [!example] 
>  ```js
>function showMessage() { 
>	console.log( 'Hello everyone!' ); 
>}
>
>showMessage();
>// Hello everyone!

**Local Variables**
___
**A variable declared within a function is only visible inside that function:

>[!example]
>```js
>function showMessage() {
>	let message = "Helo, I'm JavaScript!";
>
>console.log( message );
>}
>
>showMessage(); // Hello, I'm Javascript!
>
>console.log( message ); // Error! The The variable is local to the function
>```

However, a function has access to ***outer variables****, so they can be used and/or modified within a function.

A special case is when a variable is declared within a function with the same name as an outer variable. That outer variable is now ignored.

>[!info]
>Variables declared outside of any function, such as the outer `userName` in the code above, are called _global_.
>
>Global variables are visible from any function (unless shadowed by locals).
>
>It’s a good practice to minimize the use of global variables. Modern code has few or no globals. Most variables reside in their functions. Sometimes though, they can be useful to store project-level data.

**Parameters**
___
**We pass data to functions using parameters**

```js
function showMessage(from, text) { // parameters: from, text

console.log(from + ': ' + text);

}

showMessage('Ann', 'Hello!'); // Ann: Hello! (*)

showMessage('Ann', "What's up?"); // Ann: What's up? (**)
```
