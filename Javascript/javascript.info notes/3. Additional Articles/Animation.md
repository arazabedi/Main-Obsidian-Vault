Bezier curves have two or more control points.


>[!info]
>1. The points are ***not*** always on the curve.
>2. Curve Order = Points - 1 (2 points is a straight line, 3 is a parabolic curve etc.)
>3. A curve is always inside the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of control points.
