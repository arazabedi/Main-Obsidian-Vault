```js
window.addEventListener('keydown', e => {

const audio = document.querySelector([`audio[data-key = "${e.keyCode}"`]);

console.log(audio);

});
```

If using a data key, you must use the following syntax  for a querySelector:

```js
`tagName[data-key="variable"]`
```
*Remember to wrap in backticks if interpolating as well as quotes around the value of the data-propert*

Declaring a global variable within a function:
```js.
window.audio = ...

//instead of
//const or let
```
