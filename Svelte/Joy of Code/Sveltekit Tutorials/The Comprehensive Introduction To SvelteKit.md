You can have single-page, multi-page, SSR, SSG (static site generation).

You can deploy it anywhere. Pre-render, run on a node server, deploy to Vercel, Netlify, Deno etc. thanks to Sveltekit adapters.

Sveltekit is basically a machine that turns a machine into a response.

Sveltekit is to Svelte what NextJS or Remix is to React. Philosophically SvelteKIt is closer to Remix where it ecourages you to use the web platform and progressive enhancement to build more resilient sites.

Sveltekit blurs the lines between frontend and backend. It makes the integration between them seamless which means you don't suffer from decision fatigue.
