# DF Travel Information Backend Services
The DF Travel Information backend solves one overarching problem. Sometimes you might like to save certain locations for future reference in the weather forecasting web app of your choice. This requires a server to create a user, handle authentication, and save those location bookmarks to the user. This application handles all of that for you.

# User Stories

As a previously signed-up user I want to sign in by inputing my username and password so that I can access my account.
As a registered user I want to change my password so that I can keep up with security breaches.
As a registered user I want all my requests to be authentication with a JSON web token so that I can be sure only I can access my account.
