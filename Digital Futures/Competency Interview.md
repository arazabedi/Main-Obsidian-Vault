I recently completed the Digital Futures academy where I built full-stack web apps, earned the Java Associate Certificate and was runner-up in a hackathon with my team, partly as the judges really enjoyed the front-end which was mainly my domain. 

Before transitioning into tech I was an accounts assistant, where I noticed that many companies were behind the times and technology had a great opportunity to enhance productivity. That led me to do some self-learning, eventually a bootcamp, and now at Digital Futures I'm fully immersed in software engineering and technology in general.

My aspirations are to work on tech that improves peoples lives. I want to make things more convenient for people, and to reduce the amount of grunt work and menial activities people have to do, freeing up time for creativity and more enjoyable work.

Outside of coding I'm heavily invested in keeping up with current affairs, in particular about economics. And I also do some photography and music production, and guitar to keep my creativity afloat.

Tell me about your time at Digital Futures.

I spent 3 months specialising in software engineering. We started off with JavaScript to build a foundation, and then branched off to Java to solidify our understanding of OOP. We later built on that knowledge to gain our Java Associate Certificates. We then came back to JS and started work on full-stack development using React and Node, and the academy culminated in a full-stack team project, then finally a personal project where I built a fitness application using Next.js and Node. We also spent some time learning about the Cloud. I've learned a lot about how important foundations are, and about agile workflows since we've been using agile from the start - with user stories written from requirements, and then writing tests. Ed has emphasised test-driven development from the beginning.
