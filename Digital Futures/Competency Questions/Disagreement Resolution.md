### Question: _Give a time when you disagreed with someone on your team._

---

**Situation:**  
During a sprint for a web development project, we were deciding on how to handle the state management for a complex front-end component. I advocated for using **React’s Context API**, as it would offer a simpler solution for our needs without adding unnecessary complexity. However, a colleague strongly recommended **Redux** due to its scalability and broader use in large applications. This led to a disagreement on the best approach for our specific project, and we had a deadline approaching.

---

**Task:**  
The task was to align on a solution that would be effective for our current project but also scalable in the long term. Both Redux and the Context API had their merits, but we needed to ensure we made the best choice for the project’s complexity and team’s capacity. My goal was to come to a consensus without causing delays or friction within the team.

---

**Action:**  
I approached the disagreement with **curiosity** and a **growth mindset**, knowing that I might not have all the answers. First, I initiated a deeper technical discussion with my colleague to understand their reasoning for preferring Redux. I asked questions about their experience with both tools and how they saw Redux benefiting our specific project. This demonstrated my willingness to learn from their perspective and showed respect for their expertise.

I then proactively suggested we perform a side-by-side comparison. We quickly created two prototypes—one using the Context API and the other using Redux—focusing on the key components that required state management. This would help us evaluate both solutions in action and give the whole team a clearer picture of the benefits and trade-offs of each approach. We also factored in how easy it would be for the rest of the team to maintain the code, as not everyone was as familiar with Redux.

---

**Result:**  
After testing both approaches, we realized that while Redux was indeed more powerful for large-scale apps, the Context API offered the simplicity and flexibility we needed for our project, without adding unnecessary complexity. The team agreed to move forward with the Context API, which sped up the development process while keeping the codebase maintainable for everyone. My proactive approach not only resolved the disagreement but also kept the team focused and on schedule.

---

**Reflection:**  
This experience reinforced the importance of handling disagreements with **curiosity** and a **growth mindset**. Instead of seeing the disagreement as a conflict, I viewed it as an opportunity to learn and find the best solution for the project. By being proactive and suggesting a hands-on comparison, I helped the team reach a consensus based on evidence rather than opinions. It also deepened my **passion for technology**, as it reminded me of the importance of choosing the right tools for the right context. Moving forward, I continue to welcome differing viewpoints as a way to grow personally and improve the quality of the projects I work on.
