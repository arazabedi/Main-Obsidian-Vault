**Situation:**
During the Digital Futures hackathon with HorizonX, my team and I were tasked with developing a full-stack application aimed at helping businesses decide which large language models (LLMs) to invest in. The project involved a variety of components, including data ranking, news articles, authentication, and user roles like admin access. I led the front-end development using Next.js, while working with data analysts who handled the ranking algorithm. Given the complexity of combining multiple functionalities in a short timeframe, we knew we needed an efficient approach to break the project down into manageable steps.

**Task:**  
The main challenge was how to handle a large-scale project within the limited time available for the hackathon, ensuring all components were functional, integrated, and user-friendly. I needed to design the front-end, manage communication with the data team, and align my work with the back-end developer. A clear project management approach was critical to avoid bottlenecks and ensure we met the hackathon deadline.

**Action:**  
We adopted the agile methodology to break down the complexity. Using requirements, we created user stories that covered different features such as displaying LLM rankings, allowing admin users to update details, and integrating news articles. These stories were then organized on a Kanban board to ensure transparency and help us focus on one task at a time.

As the front-end lead, I focused on creating an intuitive UI/UX for displaying the ranked LLMs in a visually engaging way. Regular check-ins with the data team helped ensure smooth integration with the back-end and ranking system. We used 2-day iterative sprints to continuously refine the front-end design and ensure we were on track. This method kept everyone aligned, allowed us to adjust quickly when issues came up, and improved our efficiency.

**Result:**  
The result was a well-designed full-stack application where businesses could easily compare LLM models based on their readiness and perceived business value. The judges specifically commended the user interface for its clarity and ease of use, which contributed to our team finishing as runners-up in the competition. The agile process helped us break down the complex project into manageable tasks, meet our deadlines, and ensure collaboration across all teams.

**Reflection:**  
From this experience, I learned that starting a complex project with a clear framework, like agile, is essential for keeping everyone aligned and focused on their respective roles. Utilizing a Kanban board was particularly useful for tracking progress and identifying potential blockers early. Additionally, consistent communication with the data team allowed us to anticipate integration challenges and resolve them quickly. Moving forward, I plan to continue using agile methodologies, particularly for complex, time-sensitive projects where collaboration and iteration are key to success.
