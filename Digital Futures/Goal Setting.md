1. Interests and excites.

I'm very big on sports like badminton, basketball, football, tennis, even ultimate frisbee. I'm no professional but I play one of these at least twice a week. I try and get moving as much as possible and kind of feel like a puppy the hasn't been on a walk all day if I don't. 

I'm also passionate about photography and adapting vintage lenses to modern cameras. I have probably 6 film cameras and another 6 digital - mostly old ones. I'm always the camera guy at parties. I enjoy the actual taking of photographs just as much as the editing process, as that's where they become a finished product.

I have a passing interest in music production though I would like to delve much more deeply into this. It ties in with having taught myself a bit of guitar over the years.

In terms of topics or subjects I enjoy, other than anything in the computer science realm, I've been deeply seeped in political economy since I was a kid. I love conversations and ideas about the economy and have a keen interest in following developments. I think part of it comes from living in Guangzhou as a kid where development went at hyper-speed and the results were highly visible because it was largely infrastructure related.

2. Strengths and skills

I think I have good leadership qualities in the sense that I'm willing to take responsibility and make decisions that I can follow through on even if I'm not 100% certain of them. I'm quite communicative and like to share information and work well in a group as I feel it motivates me and makes my work much more enjoyable than if I were to do it alone. 

I'm also a fairly techy person, I like to get into the nitty gritty detail of things, be it for useless lore for a particular show or for more useful purposes like passing Java exams. Hence why I've decided software engineering is the way to go.

3. Values

One of my core values is that I like to create a space around myself where people feel safe and included. I always try to make sure that everyone in a group has a say and that shyness shouldn't stop someone from getting involved. This comes from myself being shy as a child and appreciating greatly whenever someone would deliberately involve me knowing this. 

4. What impact do you want to make?

I would like to be involved in something that fundamentally changes how society functions. Maybe something along the lines of the iPhone. 

On a slightly different note I would also not be averse to working in the political sphere. I think that Western economic policy is very complacent at the moment and a lot could be done to improve productivity and technological development, especially in the UK. Perhaps my experience in tech will one day prove useful in that endeavour.

5. What problems do you want to solve?

We have a big disconnect between what should be our goals as a society and the policies that are enacted. We should be trying to figure out how to make life more fulfilling for as many people as possible, and I think tech can play a huge role in the solutions. 

We've significantly improved work-life balance for office workers by introducing WFH and hybrid working styles, and I think it makes a huge difference for an individual to be able to avoid rush hour traffic, have an extra hour of sleep, not need to spend money on transportation etc. All this is possible thanks to tech, and I'd like to work towards making more positive contributions to people's lifestyles.

6. Lifestyle

I would like a workplace which is flexible, allows working from home, and if it's hybrid it would ideally be only 1 or 2 days in the office. The key for me is the general flexibility - if I wanted to go home early one day and compensate for it the next day, would that be okay for the company? I think that if my workplace is open to things like that then that's a great sign. I know it's not always possible - sometimes the culture in a company can be extremely formal, and I would be okay with that, but I think I would enjoy working in a relaxed environment more. I think that workplaces that allow their employees to take better care of themselves physically and mentally end up having better productivity anyway so it's a win-win. I do also sometimes wonder whether a digital nomad lifestyle would be right for me. It's not something i'm 100% sure about but if the right role came up one day then I think I would try it.

7. Role Models

I honestly don't know. I will have a think about this one.

8. What have you enjoyed learning about

I love getting into the little details above the inner workings of things so it has been good fun getting to grips with a lot of the Java stuff that we've been learning about.

Apart from at Digital Futures I've taken a keen interest in learning about Asian history recently since watching the new Shogun adaptation. I've been reading James Clavell's Tai-Pan which is a historical fiction on the founding of Hong-Kong and I find the interplay between Western colonial forces and the indigenous populations and hierarchy to be fascinating. The clash of cultures aspect appeals to me specifically because of my own experiences living in China, and there are little details in the book which remind me of them. Thanks to this book I've learned that there used to be a pidgin language in China and in fact the word pidgin is from a Chinese pronunciation of an English word.

9. What goals align with your personal growth?

I want to become proficient in writing code for enterprise applications, and part of that is becoming better at entering that flow state where I don't need to actively expend lot of energy thinking and it's more like I'm riding a bike. I also want to become better at managing my time and organising my schedule so that I do tasks more quickly.

10. What challenges are you willing to embrace?

I'm willing to take on a challenge for sure! Although I'm not sure what you mean in this case. If it was something like public speaking then yes I'd definitely take that one - despite the nerves.

11. What aspects of previous experiences did you enjoy?

I've really enjoyed a lot of the group projects that I've worked on throughout my time at school and university. I've had projects where I've made short films, presentations, websites etc. I've found working in a group to be really enjoyable when everyone has a good understanding of what to do and how to do it, and the work seems to fly by because of that.


12. What energises you

Working towards something - especially in a group setting - really gives me a lot of energy. I enjoy feeling like I'm contributing to something worthwhile. I also have a lot of enjoyment with regards to just using and being around technology. I do a lot of photo-editing in my spare time and in some ways it can be tedious due to the length of time it can take but I still find myself doing it and that shows how much I do enjoy it. 

I think with coding I can easily see myself doing it full time because I have had plenty of sessions where I start in the morning and I get to 12am without feeling like it's been that long.

Although I love computer-based activities, I am definitely the sort of person who needs to move and exercise a lot. I try and fit in a gym session at lunch and I feel a huge difference in energy afterwards.

13. Long-term goals

I want to start my own company at some point. I think the path to that is really getting good at my role and building connections till I have the skills and the network to make it happen. It'll be a pretty long road but I'm confident I can do it.
