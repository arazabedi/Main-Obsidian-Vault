- Low-pass around 2k
- Add 5% range LFO at around 0.5hz rate to pitch for instability (or use random if available) - slow and subtle
-  Add vintage synth filter
- Use looped envelopes (essentially LFOs - can just use LFOs if available) to target the amplification
- Add noise with lots of harmonic content (FM mode in ableton wavetable synth)
- Modulate the noise envelope
- Add unison
- Modulate the wavetable position
- Add drive and resonance to the filter

Basically,

Add instability and warmth

...using modulation.
