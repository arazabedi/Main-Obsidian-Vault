#### What is Machine Learning and What Are Its Uses?

- A brand of AI that helps build models using data for decision making purposes
- Identify customer behaviour, improve sales, helps government make decisions, diagnose cancer, drug discovery, personalised treatment plans, fraud detection, trading (with quantitative finance), asset pricing, estimate demand for commodities, optimise logistics, build recommendation systems for social media/e-commerce, retail targeting for high conversion rates, deep learning for autonomous vehicles, natural language processing for ChatGPT/Gemini, optimise crop yields, Netflix recommendations etc...
