- Make input fields off-white or light grey and the placeholder text a littl edarker but not quite black
- Input field length should create an expectation of how long the input should be before the user starts typing (even ifthe full width of the section isn't utiliised)
- Use a single input field for card details (numberm expiry, CVC)
- Support alerts should be de-emphasised by removing any background and using a grey colour instead of black. Any icon should have a colour to identify the alert/admonition

- Use a sidebar to detail pricing plan details.
- Make the form short and easy to digest
- Make the price obvious at a glance with a different font and larger font size
- Italisize the renewal information to give suttle emphasis
