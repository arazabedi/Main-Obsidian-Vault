1. **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):**
    
    - **What It Is:** EBITDA is a measure of a company's operating performance. It focuses on earnings from its core operations, excluding interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.
    - **Why It Matters:** EBITDA gives you a clearer picture of how well a company's core business is performing without being influenced by financial and accounting factors. It's often used to compare the profitability of different companies.
2. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
    
    - **What It Is:** Free cash flow is the amount of money a company generates from its operations after accounting for necessary investments in its business. It's the cash available to pay off debt, distribute dividends, or invest in growth.
    - **Why It Matters:** FCF is a key indicator of a company's financial health. Positive FCF suggests that the company is generating more cash than it's spending, which is essential for long-term sustainability.
3. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):**
    
    - **What It Is:** DCF is a valuation method that estimates the present value of future cash flows an investment is expected to generate. It takes into account the time value of money by discounting future cash flows back to their present value.
    - **Why It Matters:** DCF helps investors determine the intrinsic value of an investment based on its potential future earnings. If the estimated value is higher than the current market price, it could indicate an undervalued investment opportunity.
4. **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):**
    
    - **What It Is:** WACC is the blended average cost of both equity and debt financing used by a company to fund its operations. It's the minimum rate of return the company needs to generate to satisfy its investors and creditors.
    - **Why It Matters:** WACC helps assess whether potential investments are worth pursuing. If the expected return on an investment is higher than the WACC, it might create value for the company; if it's lower, it might not be a worthwhile endeavor.
