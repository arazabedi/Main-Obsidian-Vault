```
EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortisation
```

EBITDA is operating income but adding any depreciation and amortisation costs back.

```
Operating Income = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Opeating Expenses
```

Operating income is the money received from sales minus the cost of making those sales.

```
Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure
```

```
Operating Cash Flow (OCF) = EBITDA + Changes in Working Capital + Other Operating Cash Flows
```

EBITDA shows how well your business did without worrying about things like loans, taxes, and how much your stuff is wearing out.

Free Cash Flow is like looking at the actual money you have left after taking out the money you need to spend to keep your lemonade stand running smoothly.
