Covered Call:
- Implementation - Buy 100 shares in a stock and sell 100 calls above its current price
- Purpose - You are bullish on a stock but want extra income from it
- Max profit - Your profits are limited to the premium received for the calls sold + gains in the stock up to the strike price of the call
- Max loss - You only lose if the value of the stock goes down, but there is no protection on this beyond the initial premium received

- Vibe - Like renting your house but giving the right for the tenant to buy if the price rises
- Example - Buy BABA at $50 and sell $55 strike call at $2 premium
- Max profit - Call premium + difference to strike ($2 + $5 = $7)
- Max loss - Stock price can go to zero (but you retain the premium)

- Positives -  Low risk, generates income
- Negatives - Capped upside

Protective Put:
- Implementation - Buy 100 shares and a 100 put contracts
- Vibe - Insurance

- Example: Buy BABA at $50, buy $45 strike put for $1
- Max loss: Limited to difference between stock purchase and put strike price + put cost ($45 - $50 + $1 = $6)

- Positives - You can limit your losses to a set amount
- Negatives - If the stock goes up you've paid a premium for no gain

Iron Condor:
- Implementation - bull put spread and bear call spread

- Example - Sell $45/40 put spread + sell $55/60 call spread

- Max profit - Net premium received
- Max loss - Difference between the strike prices minus the premium
