Bull means you think the market goes up.
Bear means you think the market goes down.

Call spread means buying and selling calls at different prices.
Put spread means buying and selling puts at different prices.

Bull Call:
- Implementation - buy a lower call and sell a higher call
- Purpose - speculate upwards at a cheaper premium than a naked call
- Positives - defined max loss (premium) and higher potential return compared to stock + less impact from time decay compared to naked call
- Negatives - max profit limited by the strike of the sold call & premium paid upfront
- Good for low IV environments as premiums will be cheaper (high IV means high premiums)

Bull Put:
- Sell a higher put and buy a lower put
- Purpose - speculate upwards and make money from premiums sold
- Positives - Risk limited to difference between strike prices minus premiums received (you sell puts with a higher value than the ones you buy) + profit even if the stock stays flat + no capital required as you will be in credit (although you might need margin - I'm not sure, probably depends on the broker)
- Negatives -
