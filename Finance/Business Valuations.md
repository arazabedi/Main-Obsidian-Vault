**Book Value**
___
```
book value = equity - intangible assets 
```

Intangible assets are non-physical assets such as patents, brand, trademark, or copyright.

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**
___
```
Discounted Cash Flow = Terminal Cash Flow / (1 + Cost of Capital) Number of Years in the Future
```
The gold standard of valuation. 

It reflects a company's ability to generate liquid assets.

The limitation is the reliance on the terminal value, which varies based on assumptions on future growth and discount rates.

```
PV = CF / (1+r)^t
```

- PV = Present value of the cash flow
- CF = Future cash flow in year t
- r = Discount rate
- t = Number of years in the future

(same as above just maybe easier to digest)

This is basically just a guestimate. 

The future cash flow estimate is based on historical financial data, the free cash flow, and all of that is used to build models for projection.

The discount rate is the required rate of return that investors expect for investing in the asset.

It is typically calculated using: 
*Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)*

It's a long-arse equation. Just use a WACC calculator.

Essentially, WACC is the blended cost of funding for the company's various sources of capital. Therefore it is the minimum rate of return to break even.

WACC is the cost of borrowing and equity financing. It's a weighted average that considers the proportion of each component in the company's capital structure.

**Market Capitalisation**
___
```
Market Cap = Share Price * Total Shares
```

This doesn't take into account the company's debt. It's honestly a bit shit. Just the market price for the company as a whole.

**Enterprise Value**
___
```
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt - Cash
```

Cash here means the cash not used to fund business operations.

**EBITDA**
___
EV/EBITDA Ratio under 10 is seen as healthy.
