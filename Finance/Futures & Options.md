There are two basic derivative types:
- Forward commitment contracts (futures, forwards, swaps except CDS)
- Contingent claims (options)

Forward commitment contracts are agreed between two parties and initially cost nothing or just simply margin requirements. The contract is settled daily meaning if it goes in your favour you can take profit, if it goes against you then you must add margin (margin call).

Options are one-sided, as only one party has the right to exercise the option. Therefore there is a premium paid to the seller (writer).
