 The time taken to run an algorithm.

**Algorithm based of mathematical formula**

```java
public int findSum(int n) {
	return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

**Brute force algorithm**

```java
	public int findSum(int n) {
	int sum = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		sum = sum + i;
	}
	return sum;
}
```

The brute force algorithm has to run `sum = sum + i` n number of times, while the formula algorithm only has to run a single calculation. Therefore the formula algorithm will be faster.
