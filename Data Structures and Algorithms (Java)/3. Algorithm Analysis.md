Algorithm analysis is important in finding the algorithm for a particular task that takes the least time and has the lowest memory usage.

For example, find the sum of the first n natural numbers:

```java
int n = 4
// output: 10
// as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
```

Here are 2 solutions:

**Algorithm based of mathematical formula**

```java
public int findSum(int n) {
	return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

**Brute Force Algorithm**

```java
	public int findSum(int n) {
	int sum = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		sum = sum + i;
	}
	return sum;
}
```

To assess:

1. Time Complexity - how much time taken to complete algorithm. 
2. Space Complexity - how much memory used to complete algorithm

Clearly, the formula-based algorithm is the better one because it isn't using a loop or storing and updating a variable. See the next two files for discussion of the two assessment criteria above.
