A data structure is a way to organise data in memory. Organisation makes data easier to process.

There are two types of data structures: linear and non-linear.

**Linear** - sequentially ordered in the memory
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

**Non Linear** - stored on multiple levels, hard to traverse all elements, not easy to implement
- Tree
- Graph

Why are linear data structures easier to traverse? See the below array:

Array -> 5, 9, 3, 10

You only need to loop through one element after another using something like a for loop.

Now look at a Tree:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Root] --> B[Node 1];
    A --> C[Node 2];
    B --> D[Node 3];
    B --> E[Node 4];
    C --> F[Node 5];
    C --> G[Node 6];
```

You would need to first traverse through the nodes of node 1, then go back up the tree and traverse the nodes of node 2.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Root] --> B[Node 1];
    A --> C[Node 2];
    B --> D[Node 3];
    B --> E[Node 4];
    C --> F[Node 5];
    C --> G[Node 6];
    D --> H[Node 7];
    D --> I[Node 8];
    E --> J[Node 9];
    E --> K[Node 10];
    F --> L[Node 11];
    F --> M[Node 12];
    G --> N[Node 13];
    G --> O[Node 14];
```

Introducing only just one more layer severely adds to the complexity, as seen above.
