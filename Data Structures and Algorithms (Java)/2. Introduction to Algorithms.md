An algorithm is a set of instructions to perform a task or solve a given problem.

For example you can write instructions for preparing tea:

1. Boil water.
2. Put tea in tea pot.
3. Add hot water.
4. Put hot tea into tea cups.
5. Do you need sugar?
	 If yes, put it into tea cups
	 If no, do nothing
6. Stir, drink and enjoy !!!

Algorithms are just instructions for a computer.

Here's an example - print average of 3 given numbers:

1. Sum the 3 numbers
2. Store the sum in a variable
3. Divide the variable by 3
4. Store the result of the division in another variable
5. Print the value stored in the new variable

```java
public void findAvg(int a, int b, int c) {
	int sum = a + b + c;
	int avg = sum / 3;
	System.out.printin(avg);
}
```
