###### Why do you want to join SoftWire?

I'm excited by the idea of tackling real-world challenges with tech, so the consultancy aspect appeals to me insofar as I'll be working on different challenges with different companies, both contributing to great projects and learning a great deal from each of them. I want to make a tangible difference through my work
