#### Give an example of a time you used BDD and Cucumber.

**Situation:** During my time at Le Wagon bootcamp, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) and Cucumber as part of a daily challenge.

**Task:** My task was to apply BDD principles and use Cucumber as the testing framework to ensure the quality and functionality of a feature we had to implement.

**Action:**

- To start, I collaborated with my teammates, which were a fellow bootcamp student and a teaching assistant to  understand the feature requirements. This collaborative effort ensured that everyone had a clear understanding of the expected behaviour and acceptance criteria for the feature.
    
- I wrote BDD scenarios in Gherkin. The point being that the TA was acting as a non-technical stakeholder, and so we needed to use Cucumber to facilitate everyone being on the same page.
    
- I proceeded to implement the step definitions in Ruby. Step definitions are the code that allows for automated testing that goes behind the Gherkin scenarios.
    
- I integrated Cucumber into our project's testing framework, ensuring that BDD scenarios were executed regularly as part of our continuous integration process. This helped us identify and address any regressions early in the development cycle.
    
- During test execution, I reported and tracked any issues or defects using collaboration tools commonly used in the bootcamp, such as GitHub or GitLab, to ensure the development team promptly addressed any problems.
    
- To keep our BDD scenarios up to date, I regularly reviewed and updated them as the feature's requirements evolved, maintaining alignment between the code and the documented behavior.
    

**Result:** Through my experience with BDD and Cucumber at Le Wagon, I gained valuable insights and skills:

- Enhanced collaboration and communication within the project team by using plain language scenarios, making it easier for all team members, including non-technical ones, to understand and validate the tests.
    
- Improved test coverage and early defect detection, contributing to a higher-quality feature at the end of the project.
    
- Reduced manual testing efforts and accelerated the testing process by automating repetitive test cases, aligning with the best practices in modern software development.
    
- Provided clear and living documentation that was always up to date with the application's behavior, making it easier for everyone in the team to stay on the same page.
    

This experience at Le Wagon bootcamp equipped me with the skills needed to effectively implement BDD strategies and use Cucumber for automated testing, aligning well with the expectations of an entry-level Software Engineer in Test role. It demonstrates my ability to collaborate, write clear test cases, and work with the required technologies in an Agile environment, which is essential for success in the Quality Engineering practice.

#### What is Agile? Give an example of a time you used an agile process.

#### Can you explain your experience with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)? Also, describe the process you went through during User Acceptance Testing.
**Situation:**
I've gained a solid understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle and its phases during the bootcamp.
**Task**
I was tasked with completing a Ruby on Rails application by apply SDLC methodologies to ensure successful development and delivery of the application.
**Action:**
- **Requirements Gathering**: I was involved in the initial phase of SDLC where I collaborated with team members to understand the project's goals. I conducted interviews with other bootcamp students, TAs, and lecturers in order to plan out our requirements. I drew use case diagrams and wrote user stories to reflect these requirements.
- **Design and Planning**: I then worked with my team to design the user experience within Figma, and to draft a specification (i.e. details of what is required). I helped to draw the schema we would be using for our database, and then created a schedule so that we understood our deadlines clearly.
- **Development**: I used what I had learned in the bootcamp about Ruby and Ruby on Rails in order to write, push, and validate other team-members code on GitHub.
- **Testing**: I used RSpec to conduct unit tests, Capybara and Selenium WebDriver for Integration Testing. So, I wrote tests, executed them, and reported any bugs to the team.
- **Deployment**: I then worked together in a pair programming style (but with the whole team), to deploy the application on Heroku.
- **Result**: My experience with developing this application during the bootcamp taught me a lot about the SDLC. I learned to adapt to 

# Technical
#### What is the difference between unit testings and acceptance testing?
#### What is integration testing?

#### What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT)?

User Acceptance Testing is performed on most User Integration Testing (UIT) projects. It's also known as beta testing or end-user testing. It is tested by the intended audience (think gaming beta tests).

#### What is REST-assured?

A Java library that provides a DSL (domain-specific language) for testing REST services.

It prides itself on ruby-like syntax
#### What is the order of testing?
- Unit testing
- Quality assurance
- System testing
- Integration testing
