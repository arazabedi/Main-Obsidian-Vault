# Introduction and Importance

**Types of Interviews:**
- Technical - data structures & algorithms
- System Design - Building complex distributed systems (resilience, scaling, tradeoff between frameworks/services etc.)
- Behavioural - are you a good cultural fit (very important for tech roles, but also generically important)

**Understanding Behavioural Interviews**
- What are they: Focused on past behaviour - what have you faced, earned, did, learned, and achieved
- Purpose: to assess suitability based on real-life examples

**Difference Between Behavioural and Traditional Interviews:**
- Focus on real life experience vs hypothetical questions
- Assess soft skills and problem solving abilities
- Example-driven vs general questioning

**Why Behavioural Interviews Matter:***
- Accurate predictor of job performance - hiring/firing is expensive (not just in salary but also resources and other employee's time).
- Helps identify candidates with the right mindset
- Reduces hiring bias
- Gives open opportunity for interviewee to score as many goals and they can 
# STAR Method

- How to formulate an answer for a behavioural question.
- Give your answer completely in this sequence:

**1. Situation**
**2. Task**
**3. Action**
**4. Result**

- Situation - set the context for the story (what happened, what was the scenario, what was happening with the company, what were you asked to do, what was the overall scenario that impacted your decisions)
- Task - describe and define the challenge or responsibility (what you needed to work on, what you needed to complete, how you needed to do that)
- Actions - detail the exact, specific things that **YOU** did (focus more on yourself - not the team). What did you do, what were you responsible for, and what were the actions that you took?
- Result - Highlight the outcomes and learnings, how did you achieve it, and what improvements were made based on your actions?

Go from point a to point b to point c to point d.

Here's an example:
- Give me an example of a time you had a disagreement with your manager. How did you deal with that situation?
- Answer: 
- 1. Situation - I had a company with a nice tech stack with Microsoft Azure and lots of services and applications already up and running. The manager wanted to create a micro-service cluster from the existing monolith (ASAP). He wanted to move everything to on-premises servers and once deployed to production the manager said we can think of how to move things to the cloud later. There is too much bureaucracy when hosting everything on the cloud (for example within the structure of Azure), and so he thought it made more sense to deploy in company servers to avoid the extra workload and then think of how to deploy to the cloud later.
- 2. Task - Breaking down the monolith into the cluster of micro-services. The team was short-staffed and I had a short deadline. The rest of the company was already working on the cloud so it made more sense to deploy all the micro-services in the cloud and create a cloud native app from scratch rather than deploying on company native servers and requiring more resources later to move to the cloud. This was the disagreement.
- 3. Action - Explained to the manager that the on-premises servers were being decommissioned soon, so we would have to do the job of deploying twice. Therefore why not host on the cloud now as it would serve the company better in the long term even if it might take longer in the short term. I provided all the details and the manager came to agreement with me that we should deploy on the cloud. 
- 4. Result - We therefore had our monolith application broken down into a cluster of micro-services that were deployed in the cloud and now we have a more resilient cloud native service.

Explain the whole thing. Go into detail.
# Preparation, Research and Presentation

**Identifying Your Strengths and Weaknesses**
- Methods to identify personal strengths - asking other people, self-reflection on past experiences, getting feedback from managers and co-workers, thinking about your current situation, anonymous polls
- Acknowledge and address weaknesses - (example: getting involved in the conversation, communication vs giving a huge introduction before getting into the main issue thus wasting time). And how can you improve upon your weaknesses.

**Reflecting on Relevant Past Experiences**
- What have you done, what challenges have you faced, what was your achievement, what did you learn from it, how can you teach others... (these are the sort of questions that will be asked)
- Make good points/stories and have them ready for the interview
- Don't repeat the same story - it makes a good impact to have different scenarios for each type of question
- ALWAYS prepare the stories, do not make them up as you go. You need to give a lot of context and detail, and you have to go through all the STAR steps so you need to have answers ready.
- Think of 15-20 scenarios based on your career and life experiences. That should be enough to cover all your bases.
- Structure them for interview storytelling
