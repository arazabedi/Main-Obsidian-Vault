MVP (easy to screw up):
How fast can you get something into your user's hands?
2 months good, 2 weeks better
You are nothing until you launch

Growth:
#1 metric for determining whether you're going to raise money
Experiment with ads (worst strategy)
Reference customers (spread the word)
# Usage = Sharing !!!!!!!!!!!

Press:
Do it yourself - waste of money to hire others
PR is exactly like business development
Warm introduction from someone who is already being written about
Real news - something launching/money being raised
Follow up with the - will continue to provide value

Raising money:
If you don't need money, people will want to give it to you!
Structure the company so that it only pays for the living expenses of the co-founders
Meetings with investors should be tightly scheduled - all the investors in one week to create buzz and lines all the investors up if one of them decides to move forward
Investors need FOMO
HAVE GROWTH - the single biggest solution to fundraising

Fundraising Problems:
0. Have you launched? Launch requires no fundraising!
1. Are you growing? 
2. Are you talking to the press?
3. Build momentum!
4. Focus on people who have the problem (customers can be great initial (early stage) investors)
5. Spend less money
6. Check how much you spend every month
7. Then spend less

Hiring:
Increase the average level of talent in the company.
The first hires should be smarter than you but more risk-averse.
Be fair and transparent.
They should get stock. Tell them how much stock is outstanding.
Tell them if their salary is typical for what you give and if not then be honest.
First employees will show loyalty if you do.
Hire slow.
