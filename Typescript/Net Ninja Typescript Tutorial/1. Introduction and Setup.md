What is Typescript?
1. A superset of JavaScript that compiles down to JavaScript
2. Allows the use of strict types
3. Supports modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, `let`, `const`
4. Add extra features such as generics, interfaces, tuples etc.

Typescript forces us to write cleaner code and enforces type-safety which allows for an easier time when bug-fixing.
