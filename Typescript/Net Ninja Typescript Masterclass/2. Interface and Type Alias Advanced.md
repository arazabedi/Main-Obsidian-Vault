### Reusable Interfaces

So as a reminder: interfaces define a data structure that values that implement the interface have to adhere to.

A variable can implement an interface simply by containing an object with the property/properties given in the interface, but with a value attached to it (see the variable `something` below).

If a variable adheres to an interface but also contains further data, it can still be used as an argument in a function call.

```ts
interface hasQuantity {
	quantity: number
}

const something: hasQuantity = { quantity: 50 }

const fruit = {
	name: 'mango',
	quantity: 50,
}

const vehicle = {
	name: 'car',
	quantity: 3,
}

const person = {
	name: 'mario',
	age: 30,
}

function printQuantity(item: hasQuantity): void {
	console.log(`the quantity of the item is ${item.quantity}`);
}

printQuantity(fruit) // okay
printQuantity(vehicle) // okay
printQuantity(person) // not okay
printQuantity({ quantity: 50, title: 'something' }) // not okay

```

Fruit has the `quantity` property, therefore it adheres to the `hasQuantity` interface, although it is not explicitly declared. Same with vehicle. 

The `person` variable does not contain a `quantity` property and so cannot be used in the `printQuantity` function. 

>[!warning]
>Note that you cannot pass an object that doesn't adhere perfectly to an interface unless you've created it ahead of time through a declaration or by creating an instance of a class that adheres to the interface (see the example of the last `printQuantity()` function call). 
>
>This is because when you create an object within the parentheses of a function, it must be an instance of the parameter type.

>Duck typing means that so long as an object contains the methods and properties required by the type, then it is compatible. 
>
>Gradual typing is when a language allows both static typing and dynamic typing within the same language (TS is a JS superset, and JS is dynamically-typed). 
>
>Structural typing is when type compatibility and equivalence is based on structure and definition, not things like name or place of declaration. This is a similar concept to duck typing, but with slight nuances.

>This is where TypeScript differs a lot to Java, which uses normative typing where compatibility and equivalence of types are determined by explicit declarations and/or names of the types.

### Function Signature

**Function Signatures - Type Aliases for functions**

You can use the syntax in the first line below in order to set in stone the return type of functions adhering to a type. 

```ts
type Calculator = (numOne: number, numTwo: number) => number

function addTwoNumbers(a: number, b: number) {
	return a + b
}

function multiplyTwoNumbers(first: number, second: number) {
	return first * second
}

function squareNumber(num: number) {
	return num * num
}

function randomNumber() {
	return Math.random()
}

function joinTwoNumbers(numOne: NumberConstructor, numTwo: number) {
	return `${numOne}${numTwo}`
}

let calcs: Calculator[] = []

calcs.push(addTwoNumbers) //okay
calcs.push(multiplyTwoNumbers) //okay
calcs.push(squareNumber) //okay
calcs.push(randomNumber) //okay
calcs.push(joinTwoNumbers) // not okay
```

Note that:
1. The function doesn't need to contain any of the parameters listed in the type definition
2. Only the return matters
3. Despite not needed any parameters in order to adhere, any parameters that you do use in the function must be of the types listed in the type definition

### Function Signatures on Interfaces

You can add function signatures as interface requirements:

```ts
interface HasArea {
	name: string
	calcArea: (a: number) => number
}

interface HasArea {
	name: string
	calcArea(a: number): number
}

// Choose one of the two syntax styles above - both are fine (second is more natural to me)

const shapeOne: HasArea = {
	name: 'square',
	calcArea(length: number) {
		return length * length
	},
}

const shapeTwo: HasArea = {
	name: 'circle',
	calcArea(r: number) {
		return Math.PI * r^2
},
}

shapeOne.calcArea(5)
shapeTwo.calcArea(10)
```

### Extending Interfaces

Similar to class inheritance, an interface can ***extend*** another interface.

```ts
interface HasFormatter {
	format(): string
}

interface Bill extends HasFormatter {
	
}

```

Bill in the above snippet will contain the property of `HasFormatter`.

Let's continue on...

```ts
interface HasFormatter {
	format(): string
}

interface Bill extends HasFormatter {
	id: string | number
	amount: number
	server: string
}

const user = {
	id: 1,
	format(): string {
		return `This user has an id of ${this.id}`
	}
}

const bill = {
	id: 2,
	amount: 50,
	server: 'mario',
	format(): string {
		return `Bill with id ${this.id} has ${this.amount} to pay`
	}
}

// Variable bill adheres to both Bill and HasFormatter

function printFormatted(value: HasFormatter): void {
	console.log(value.format());
}

function printBill(bill: Bill): void {
	console.log(`Server:`, bill.server);
	console.log(bill.format());
}

printFormatted(user) // This user has an id of 1
printFormatted(bill) // Bill with id 2 has 50 to pay
printBill(user) // Server: undefined (BAD)
printBill(bill) // Server: mario
				// Bill with id 2 has 50 to pay

```

Key takeaway - If an object doesn't cover all the properties of an interface required by a function parameter, it cannot be used as an argument in that function.

### Extending Type Aliases

Here's the syntax for extending Person to User:

```ts
type Person = {
	id: string | number
	firstName: string
}

type User = Person & {
	email: string
}
```

```ts
const person = {
	id: "2",
	firstName: 'yoshi',
	email: 'yoshi@netninja.dev'
}

function printUser(user: User) {
	console.log(user.id, user.email, user.firstName);
}

printUser(person) // 2 yoshi@netninja.dev yoshi
```
