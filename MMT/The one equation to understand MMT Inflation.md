    Total Valuation = Total Savings = Unit Value * Saved Units

The truth is, you don’t have to understand how prices work,
you don’t have understand sectoral balances you don’t
have to understand foreign trade and all that.

All those things can be worked out if you start from the
right starting point.  That is the following question:

> “What is the total value, of all financial assets, issued
> by the government in question, held by entities which
> aren’t that government?”

Because we are talking about macro economics,
you have to look at the big picture, and that means
assessing aggregates.  The most important aggregate
is the total value of outstanding financial assets which
are issued by that entity.

The underlying reason, is that governments do not issue
shares.  Because there are no shareholders, and there 
is no real valuation for governments, it is impossible to
assess solvency.

So practically, the currency becomes shares.  I say the
currency, but really that includes bonds, or any financial
assets the entity has explicitly committed to.

But shares of what? They are not voting shares, clearly
because you can’t buy votes.  They are simply claims
to future production, potentially enforced by taxation.

The biggest element of Modern Monetary Theory is how
you relate different financial assets.  Mainstream draws a line
between assets based on liquidity.  It calls these things
M0, M1, M2, M3.  These are really nebuluously defined,
and hard to measure, because there is no recognition of 
who or where they are issued.  Furthermore, there may be
privacy concerns.

For many problems, this approach makes sense, but for the
issue of inflation, it does not make sense.  Because ultimately,
inflation is about the trust in, and prospects of, the entity which
issues a currency.

So instead of distinguishing assets by their liquidity,
MMT distinguishes assets by who issues them.  To do this, it
relies on chartalist theory, which looks at complex legal and
cultural traditions.  Money is meaningful, in many cases, because
it is legally recognized, for the settlement of legal obligations.

## What financial assets does the U.S. Government issue?

 1. Federal reserve notes (cash and coin)
 2. Treasury bonds
 3. Reserves at the Fed

As far as I know, those are the 3 important assets issued by the U.S. government.
Now, there are also treasury issued coins, but as of now, that’s not important.

Now, if you want to assess the total valuation, the biggest of those 3 by far,
is treasury bonds.

Stopping inflation is just a matter of defending a valuation of all circulating assets.

If you are double the number of units in circulation, and maintain the same
total valuation, the value of each unit cuts in half.  But sometimes, doubling
the number of units, may cause trust in your financial assets to falter, so your
total valuation could drop by much more than that.

But hyperinflation, only happens when you ignore the total valuation, and
do not try to defend it.

The most important thing to note, that if you pay more interest on bonds,
than the rate of inflation, you are not really helping yourself, but rather
forcing yourself to try to defend a valuation that is too high.

## Bonds don’t compete with other investments

Because cash simply circulates, some private party
will hold it, unless the central bank buys it.  Even
if you buy treasury bonds, that money will be spent,
so it is still circulating.  The money is only removed 
from public circulation, if the central bank buys it.

So while we use money to invest in things, investing
doesn’t change the total amount of money, only who
holds it.  This is why treasury bonds do not compete
with the return of other investments.  Treasury bonds
only compete with cash.  Someone can choose to 
hold liquid cash, and accept depreciation over the 
period they hold it, or they can buy a bond. Those
are the only two impactful decisions.  Buying another
asset, merely shifts that decision to someone else.

So the notion, that bonds must pay more than inflation,
is obviously false.  When inflation is high, people value
the cash, based on what they expect the price to be,
when they want to spend it.

If inflation is 20%, then a 10% return on bonds splits
the difference.  It reduces the value of outstanding debt
by 10% a year, while paying people who buy bonds 10%
more than holding cash.

To fight inflation, a bond rate, half the inflation
rate, is the most fair solution.

If you pay a bond rate above inflation, you are siphoning
value away from currency holders to bond holders.

If you pay no bond rate, there is no incentive to hold a currency,
and people will spend it as fast as they can.

Ultimately, if you face inflation, you may not be able to
support a valuation as high as you had in the past.  But
inflation targets miss the big picture, while valuation
targets are easy to understand.
