##### The General Formula for Capital
___
p121

Commodity production and circulation creates capital. This started in the 1500s. The result is the creation of money.

Capital takes the form of money when it first emerges next to feudal, landed power. 

p121-122

Money is the initial form of capital. At first the only difference between money as money and money as capital is the intention behind it - capital money is already capital in its purpose, as it undergoes the M-C-M process which transforms it into money.

I think Marx's point here is that money capital might as well be considered capital given that that's what it is or will be used for.

Next Marx wonders why anyone would expose their money to the M-C-M  circuit for an equivalent amount of money (making no money on their trade). 

He argues that there is a fundamental difference between the M-C-M process and the C-M-C process. The former is about making more money whilst the latter is about swapping use-values. He wants to meditate on these processes further.

What do the two circulations have in common? They both contain a C-M and an M-C (he calls them phases).

p123

The difference between them is that the phases appear in reverse order. 

In C-M-C we sell first, buy second. In M-C-M we buy first and sell second.

C-M-C is mediated by money whereas M-C-M is mediated by the commodity.

C-M-C results in a use value. M-C-M results in money - or as we shall see it, capital.

I need a simpler way to write these circuits. Let's call them the commodity circuit and the capital circuit.

The capital circuit has the intention of advancing money, not expending it. The same commodity changes hands twice, rather than the same money. 

I think Marx is trying to get you to eek out that the whole point of capital is that like a boomerang, it always comes back.

Money in the capital circuit therefore operates in such a way as to always come back to its starting point - the magnitude of the gain (or loss) doesn't negate the reality of the circulation of money when it takes the form of capital. 

I remember David Harvey's formulation of money as capital in motion.

p124

So money can be capital or it can be mere money. What determines this is how it circulates.

The purpose of the commodity circuit is consumption. The purpose of the capital circuit is the make more money.

The commodity circuit exchanges one use-value with another of equal value.

p125

Use values differ in use, whereas money can only differ in magnitude. The capital circuit therefore only arises - would only happen - if the magnitude on offer through the procession of the circuit is greater than where we started.

M-C-M is therefore actually M-C-Mâ€² - The second M is larger. The difference between the M's is called surplus value.

The magnitude of money, which represents a magnitude of value (socially necessary labour time) advanced at the start of the circuit is retained in the form of a commodity of equal value, but the value takes on surplus-value by the end of the circuit in a process of valorisation, transforming the original value into capital.
